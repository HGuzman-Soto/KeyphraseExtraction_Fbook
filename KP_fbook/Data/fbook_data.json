        "As we get closer to the upcoming elections, I want to reveal a few of the tricks candidates use to avoid allowing themselves to be politically accountable. Including: 1) \"I have experience, so I don't need a labor or racial justice policy plan.\" 2) \"I was born in the community, so I don't need a labor or racial justice policy plan.\"... 3) \"I do good works, e.g., coach little league, so I don't need a labor or racial justice policy plan.\" 4) \"I grew up poor, so I don't need a labor or racial justice policy plan. (This last one is funny, because just because someone escaped poverty doesn't mean they have insight into governing for community uplift. That's like finding someone who escaped jail, and expecting them to have a plan to end mass incarceration, when what they really know is how to do all of the grimy, grimy business-- paying off guards, crawling through sewers, exchanging sexual favors-- required for an individual escape.)\" 5) \"I'd be the first black or first latinx or first LGBTQ or youngest. etc., so I don't need to articulate a labor or racial justice policy plan.\" 6) \"We need to be unified, so I don't need to articulate a labor or racial justice policy plan.\" - 6a. \"But, but, but Trump!\"  I'm still going to need you to articulate a labor and racial justice platform. Remember, one of the most important qualities in a political candidate is the ability to remove him/her in the next election. You don't want to install anyone to an office where it's going to require a crane and a team of engineers to dislodge them if they don't govern appropriately. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Hmc8PomkM See More"

        "This Monday, Aug. 10, we are coming back for a second Moral Monday March on McConnell, where we will stage a digital “sit-in” and massive call-in to Senator McConnell’s offices to demand he stop causing misery, meanness and mayhem for our people and nation. Earlier this week, we mobilized thousands of people for an online Moral Monday March and call-in to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand a full and just relief package. Together we flooded McConn...ell’s phone lines with thousands of calls. And now is no time to stop pushing!  It’s clear now that McConnell is willing to sacrifice the safety of the poor, of low-wage workers, of teachers and even our children in his effort to continue an extremist agenda in tandem with the White House to block a full and just relief package and force schools to re-open even when it’s not safe to do so. Join us on Monday, August. 10 at 3:30pm ET for a Moral Monday Digital March on McConnell! See More"

It was the day of expulsion of over 600,000 Palestinians.  After the 6 day war, israel took control of Gaza, the West Bank, - both populated with Palestinians - Syria’s Gonna Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula. While many Palestinians were displaced internally, going from refugee camp to refugee camp in the West Bank, many fled to Jordan, Leb...anon and Syria.  The Sinai Peninsula was eventually returned to Egypt, but the other territories remain under the military regime of the colonial state.  Yoom El Naksa marks another Nakba - scarfing the next generation of Palestinians.  We honor the lives displaced by this tragedy, clinging onto the resolve to someday return home. See More"

The Left speaks much about power, yet it does not have the ability to force those who it counts as enemies to submit to its will, because our enemies have force and the ability to use it with public approval. To seize power we need to flip this situation so that we may use force against our enemies with public approval to bend them to our will."

Here's Warsan Shire's poem \"Home.\" no one leaves home unless... home is the mouth of a shark you only run for the border when you see the whole city running as well your neighbors running faster than you breath bloody in their throats the boy you went to school with who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory is holding a gun bigger than his body you only leave home when home won’t let you stay. no one leaves home unless home chases you fire under feet hot blood in your belly it’s not something you ever thought of doing until the blade burnt threats into your neck and even then you carried the anthem under your breath only tearing up your passport in an airport toilet sobbing as each mouthful of paper made it clear that you wouldn’t be going back. you have to understand, that no one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land no one burns their palms under trains beneath carriages no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled means something more than journey. no one crawls under fences no one wants to be beaten pitied no one chooses refugee camps or strip searches where your body is left aching or prison, because prison is safer than a city of fire and one prison guard in the night is better than a truckload of men who look like your father no one could take it no one could stomach it no one skin would be tough enough the go home blacks refugees dirty immigrants asylum seekers sucking our country dry niggers with their hands out they smell strange savage messed up their country and now they want to mess ours up how do the words the dirty looks roll off your backs maybe because the blow is softer than a limb torn off or the words are more tender than fourteen men between your legs or the insults are easier to swallow than rubble than bone than your child’s body in pieces. i want to go home, but home is the mouth of a shark home is the barrel of the gun and no one would leave home unless home chased you to the shore unless home told you to quicken your legs leave your clothes behind crawl through the desert wade through the oceans drown save be hunger beg forget pride your survival is more important no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear saying — leave, run away from me now i dont know what i’ve become but i know that anywhere is safer than here See More"

        "On May 25th, 2020, George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. An officer knelt on his neck, ignoring his pleas of “I can’t breathe”— the same pleas Eric Garner made six years ago on Staten Island, NY as police murdered him via chokehold. The city of Minneapolis has since erupted with revolutionary activity. Three days after Floyd’s murder, on the night of May 28th, in an escalation unprecedented on U.S. soil, the people of Minneapolis set fire to... the Third Precinct. Video footage shows cop cars and vans fleeing the scene— rats from a sinking ship— while the people pelted them with objects and shouted at them. Floyd’s murder took place on Memorial Day: a day set aside annually by the State for the expressed purpose of celebrating its ability to expand its white supremacist empire globally. The National Guard, meanwhile, was called in in a failed attempt to crush the revolt. What the people of Minneapolis have achieved ushers in a new stage in the war against the State. RAM stands in solidarity with the people of Minneapolis, and oppressed people everywhere who are fighting for their lives. We are inspired and humbled by what we have seen. See More"

        "On May 25th, 2020, George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. An officer knelt on his neck, ignoring his pleas of “I can’t breathe”— the same pleas Eric Garner made six years ago on Staten Island, NY as police murdered him via chokehold. The city of Minneapolis has since erupted with revolutionary activity. Three days after Floyd’s murder, on the night of May 28th, in an escalation unprecedented on U.S. soil, the people of Minneapolis set fire to... the Third Precinct. Video footage shows cop cars and vans fleeing the scene— rats from a sinking ship— while the people pelted them with objects and shouted at them. Floyd’s murder took place on Memorial Day: a day set aside annually by the State for the expressed purpose of celebrating its ability to expand its white supremacist empire globally. The National Guard, meanwhile, was called in in a failed attempt to crush the revolt. What the people of Minneapolis have achieved ushers in a new stage in the war against the State. RAM stands in solidarity with the people of Minneapolis, and oppressed people everywhere who are fighting for their lives. We are inspired and humbled by what we have seen. See More"

In the Village, we have different groups, houses in the ballroom scene. Being on the Pier, you’d see the different houses voguing against each other, dancing and playing double-dutch and stuff. As the night came, the wee hours of the morning came, people would still be out there. And I realized these people don’t have homes. They stay outside. Like literally outside. “Eventually I started a non-profit [that supports homeless trans people]. My ultimate goal is to have housing for all. It is a human right to have shelter. “I use my voice to be visible and stand up for injustices against discrimination of LGBTQ+ people and killing of trans people. My advice to activists that want to make their voices heard is to keep the focus on the people. Do not take it to heart, the negative and disrespect that comes with this work. There are people that don’t like us, and will never understand who we are.” 📸: Quil Lemons See More"

Being Black I’ve had to grow a tough skin, learn to love mys...elf, and to work a thousand times harder than most. I’ve literally told myself, ‘If I can be Black and proud, I definitely can love being my gay self.’ “There’s not a lot of representation for artists like me. I feel like that’s disheartening but I also know where I am. I get the territory. You know, we’re in the South. I get that. “But what I take pride in every day is that being in my role [at the arts council], I gain more visibility.

Local authorities and businessmen established a network of brothels under the Recreation and Amusement Association, which was state-funded, some in places like police dormitories. At its height, the RAA had 70,000 women working in its brot...hels, with around 80,000 at independent brothels for the 350,000 US troops in the country. The first brothel established by the RAA, Komachien (\"The Babe Garden\") had 38 women, who had 15-60 clients each day. The official justification for the network was \"to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls.\" US military officials were aware that some women in the brothels had been enslaved, and others coerced or tricked by responding to fake advertisements for other jobs. One 19 year old girl, Natsue Takita, responded to an ad for an office worker. She was then told the only available posts were for \"comfort women\" and persuaded to accept it. She killed herself by jumping in front of a train a few days later. A memo from Lt Col Hugh MacDonald explained \"The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family\". He also admitted that \"in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists.\" Eventually, facing rampant sexually transmitted infections amongst the troops, as well as complaints from army chaplains, Gen MacArthur declared the brothels off-limits to US personnel on 25 March 1946.

        "Well everyone has an end to their competitive time in speech and debate, and most everyone has their obligatory end of career post. I’ve been blanking on mine a lot because it’s been such a long run, on and off, and still feels weird it’s all over. The tldr is that I’m so glad I’ve spent 8 years competing in speech and debate and met so many amazing people I have thanks for.  Starting back in high school, freshman year me didn’t think I’d end up a debate kid until my mom sugg...ested I take it as an elective. My debate teacher and coach Mr Zuercher was formative for making me enjoy debate and wanting to purchase inconceivable amounts of books probably for the rest of my life. My best friend, Quentin McTeer, was the biggest motivator to push myself to be good in debate and want to succeed. I remember spending summers at debate camps, weekend debate tournament trips, and the unnecessary amount of time we were working on debate prep in other classes.  My two years of debate at the College of Idaho were filled with some of my closest friends and most fun memories. We only got to debate for a year, but Logan Dennis was one of my most fun partners and one of my brothers. All that blabbering incoherent rambles about Deleuze even got you to slip a quote in your senior paper. Aanish Shamim is the funniest, nerdiest person ever and has been my friend since high school. We were partners on and off for two years, but to date you’re still the only person I’ve gotten 1st place at a tournament with #unr. I’ll never forget our ukulele anthem PMC’s.  My last year at WWU has been a great end to my years in debate. If it wasn’t for the fact you were my favorite competitor when I was at CofI I probably wouldn’t have ended up here. Chris Coles (Lila Lavender), you’re one of the smartest people I’ve ever met and have appreciated your guidance in debate and beyond. Kinny Torre is also an amazing person I’m glad I’ve met from moving to WA. Being able to work with you at debate camps the last two summers and call you my coach and close friend is something I’m really grateful for. Sarah Wheeler and Brenner Barclay have been the worlds best teammates to have and the best company at our sometimes week long debate-ventures. Margaret Rockey was always supplying the groovy tunes and campaign to eat more chicken. And lastly, Cameron Allen, you’ve been a hoot and a better partner than I could’ve asked for. I’ll never forget my last year of debate filled with cheaters go home, gundams and golems, jews with guns, and you forgetting to read offense.  I certainly haven’t thanked everyone whose been an important person during my time in debate, but it was at least a good shot. It’s been a heck of a time y’all 🤙 See More"

From divorce to academic failures, to performance failures, and death of a few people who I had the privilege to serve this great country with. It has also given me some of the best moments I have had in life. It has restored and created some great friendships, I have become a much better musician, and I have learn to take some of punches and move on. I am ...truly happy for every moment that happened this year, good or bad because they are all learning experiences that will help make this coming year great. To all of you who have allowed me into your lives and to those I have had the change to be around this year thank you so much for all the wonderful memories of 2019. May you have a great 2020 and gods speed to all of you!! Now can we just fast forward to the 5th so we can leave for Vienna already lol. Happy New Years everyone!! See More"

I can't believe that this fall semester is almost of and that 2020 is just around the corner. I am super happy that I get to make music with all of you. One sad thing about this concert is that my great friend Emily Phipps who has been with me since we transferred to PLU just played her last performance with the wind ensemble. She is graduating this semester. Thanks for being a great friend Emily Phipps I am gonna miss our day pre-rehearsal chats and runs to Starbucks. Overall happy about the concert and now all I need to do is really focus on academics and finish the next 4 weeks strong!! #whyPLU #golutes #PLUWE"

Humanism is, in general, the idea of moving past race and creating true equality and Anti-racism is, in general, the idea that race is key to understanding a person's identity.  Neither is racist, nor an effort to oppress specific groups. Can we possibly elevate the dialogue?

Surely if I had existed from all eternity I should have given and consecrated to you my whole soul, my whole heart, all my thoughts, designs, and affections. But not having existed from all eternity, I should at least have turned to you with my whole mind and will as soon as I was capable of doing so. Alas! I can truly say with Saint Augustine, “Too late have I loved you, O Eternal Goodness.” Forgive me, I beseech you, O my God. I wish to begin now to love, serve, and honor you with all my heart, with all my soul and with all my strength; I beg you to grant me that grace by the infinite love you have borne me from all eternity and give me grace to return your love. Saint John Eudes Saint John Eudes († 1680) was largely responsible for initiating and popularizing devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.  (Part of the article excerpted from Magnificat 8/19/2020)    8月19日教會記念這位聖德斐然的聖若望歐德 / St. John Eudes，他畢生致力於推動聖母至聖之心的敬禮，令人感佩！聖人的一生簡介，特錄自「我靈讚頌主網站」來一窺堂奧： 聖若望歐德（St. John Eudes）耶穌聖母男修會及仁愛聖母女修會創辦人 十六世紀中，法國諾曼田列城有一家農戶，戶主依撒格歐德，娶妻高賓，子女六人。最長的男孩若望，自幼熱心敬主；九歲時，鄰家兒童打他的臉，他轉過臉來，請那個兒童打另一邊。 若望十四歲，赴康城耶穌會學校讀書，學業完成，棄家修道。一六二一年領受小四品，在康城研究神學。 若望立志入經堂修會，一六二三年，徵得父母同意，辦理入會手續。因若望才德出眾，修會當局特准他提早講道。一年後，若望被派往歐巴維，在公德隆神父門下受訓，聖德大有進步。 兩年後，諾曼田發生大疫，若望奮不顧身，為病人服務。一六三一年，康城也發生瘟疫，若望再度獻身救護病人。為了避免同院修士被染，他一人住在田野，與眾隔離，每天飲食由附近修院送來。 若望一連十年，來往各地，向教友講道，聲譽很高。每天講道完畢，許多教友向他辦告解。皮萊主教雷加目說：「當代意大利和法國的著名講道員，我都聽過，但是沒有一位能像若望歐德神父那樣感動人心。」統計若望一生，作大規模公開講道一百餘次。 若望鑒於失足的婦女回頭改過後無處安身，將她們托付熱心的女教友照管，但是那辦法並不切合實際需要。 一個出身貧家的女教友雷米，向若望提議，創建一所收容所，照顧無家可歸的不幸子女。若望接受了建議，在一六四一年，創建了第一所女子收容所，委托康城往見會修女管理。 若望經過了長時期的祈禱、考慮，徵詢了神長的意見，於一六四三年和經堂修會脫離，創設新修會。這個新修會專為培養神職人員，創辦修院，訓練有才德的堂區傳教司鐸。這年聖母領報瞻禮，修會在康城正式成立，定名為「耶穌聖母男修會」，會規以經堂修會會規為藍本，會友是不隸屬任何修會的神職人員。第一批會員共六人，包括若望歐德神父在內，會徽是耶穌和聖母瑪利亞的聖心，象徴著耶穌永恒的聖愛。 十日的公開講道。就在那一年，他創設了一個新的女修會「仁愛聖母女修會」。 一六五三年，若望在呂銳建立修院。一六五九年，在路洪建立修院。一六六六年，仁愛聖母女修會獲得教宗亞歷山大七世的批准。 若望不斷來往各地，作公開講道，他在愛佛利和萊納先後建立了兩個修院。 若望全力提倡耶穌聖心和聖母聖心的敬禮。他的修會舉行聖母至聖聖心的瞻禮，他也編了一本恭敬耶穌聖心的書。一六七Ｏ年八月三十一日，萊納修院第一次舉行耶穌聖心瞻禮。提倡耶穌聖心敬禮的，若望歐德雖然不是第一個人，至少他是具體編訂耶穌聖心和聖母聖心敬禮的人。一六七四年，教宗格肋孟十世頒賜特別大赦，給歐德創立的耶穌聖心善會和聖母聖心善會。 若望暮年潛心編選《天主至聖之母聖心》，這本書在他去世前一個月才脫稿。 一六七五年，若望在寒冬，一連九個星期露天作公開講道。一六八Ｏ年八月十九日安逝主懷。一九二五年榮列聖品。 聖若望歐德，請為我們祈禱！ See MoreSee Translation"

        "Hi! I’m Zac Davis and I’m looking to coach and judge for students this debate season,So you’re probably wondering why you should consider me:As a debater I was successful on the national circuit and qualified to the TOC twice despite lacking a school debate coach or strong institutional support, going 3-3 as a Junior and choosing to coach rather than attend Corona-toc. Other notable results include a positive record at NSDAs being ranked 6th in California by the NSDA, and bei...ng a runner up at the Apple Valley RR, winning the VBI Varsity tournament and reaching quarterfinals at RKS’s Varsity tournament.However, not all good debaters are good teachers. I’ve always placed heavy emphasis on a strong foundation so I focused on research and understanding the philosophy behind the arguments I read. This philosophy transfers heavily into my coaching style. I want to enable students, not think for them.  I have experience coaching 40+ debaters for Policy, LD, and Parliamentary debate and have worked with programs such as PepTalk, W.indebate, ODI, VBI, UTNIF, and currently Triumph Debate. While I was still debating I founded and organized Verge Debate, a mutual prep sharing and coaching team for small school debaters without school coaches, and so I have lots of experience coordinating prep assignments, talking about strategies, and assisting with long term and pre-round preparation and a majority of our members reached TOC for the first time as Verge members. I am familiar with overcoming prep disparities, organizing collaboration in drills mocks and prep assignments, and providing specialized and flexible support to different debaters needs. Over the summer alone I’ve judged 40+ rounds, so I have plenty of experience working online and in-depth knowledge of modern debate trends. In summary I’m incredibly passionate about debate content and strategy and have the experience to back it up.For those already on the circuit:I specialized in theory das and ks, but have lots of experience innovating phil and larp/policy positions as well. Whether you are looking to understand the literature behind a dense kritik or learn how to do a 1AR vs 7 off, I can help! Reach out for any more details about argumentative specifics.In Conclusion:Beyond my debate and coaching experience I want to emphasize coaching goes beyond that. While my debaters certainly will sharpen their debate skills, I emphasize even more importantly the value of presentation, conversation, and research skills debate teaches, which have benefited other aspects of my life such as academics and organization. Additionally, I encourage debaters to learn more about politics and form their own opinions and develop critical thinking skills to help make the ideas they persuade others of are good ones. I care about the emotional wellbeing of the debaters I coach, and will modify drill schedules around mental health and help coach students through tough losses.Sorry I know the pitch is long feel free to read as little or much I just want you to have access to info about me before making your decision about coaching, and if you are on the fence I recommend you reach out to students and organizations I've worked with or are working with for more information about my coaching style.Here are some emails, reach out to me if you want more.Sarah Zheng from Dulles pandazh13@gmail.comLukas Krause from Mitty lukrauwork@gmail.comOlivia He from Quarry Lane oxh38389@gmail.comDirector of LD Debate at UTNIF sunhee.simon@gmail.comODI Admin and Co-Lab Leader for Top Lab pdfox0513@gmail.comDirector of Triumph triumphdebate@gmail.comManaging Director and Head of HR of Victory Briefs Institute anthony@victorybriefs.comI hope you want to work with me in the future, and best of luck debating!Please reach out to me via pm or zacjudges@gmail.com if interested.I’m also looking to be hired to judge at any TOC bid distributing tournaments throughout the year so reach out if you need one.

TAKE ACTION: Throw all your money at & make calls for Foster Campbell, a Democrat who's got a runoff Senate race happening in a few weeks. It's times like this where I wish more states had runoffs! The difference between a 52–48 senate and a 51–49 senate is HUGE. This runoff historically has dismal turnout, but organizing to inform folks abt the importance of this election cou...ld make the difference. Volunteer, donate, and read more about him here: https://medium.com/…/the-2016-election-isnt-over-yet-f1ea6f… I just donated, you can donate here: http://www.fostercampbell2016.com/ See More"

Recently, as Claire and her husband Dustin Davies were hastily evacuating from their home, they fastened their 2-year old daughter into her carseat and slammed the doors.  Then, as they were backing down the driveway, their little girl suddenly shouted from the back seat. “Bye bye Amora's crib!  Bye bye... Amora's socks!  Bye bye Amora's house!  Thankfully the Davies family made it safely out of the firestorm’s path.  But by the next day they received news that Amora was right.  All that was left of their home was ashes. 💔  Please pray for ALL who are effected by the fires.  And if you don’t pray, then please wish everyone luck! UPDATE! (from Theresa)  A GoFundMe account has been established for Claire and Dustin Davies and their baby girl, Amora.  Please read their full story See More"

In all my years of water-skiing, there are only a couple times that photos were taken and this is one of them.  But after Jeri sat her camera on the dock, someone bumped it into the lake.  I was able to find the camera under 10 feet of water and 3 inches of silt.  We decided to have the wet film developed anyway.  This is one of the images that sort of survived, though the water damage is clearly present.  But hey! It’s one of only three photos that I have."

        "LEXINGTON COMMUNITY PLEASE READ!  Yesterday, June 4th, 2020 Lexington MA held a vigil for George Floyd a victim of police brutality, may he rest in peace. Also on this day, our town voted 122-65 to spend $125k on planning the construction of a new shooting range for local police that will amount to 3.5-5 million dollars.  When I was a senior at LHS in 2018, the shooting at Marjory Stoneham Douglas High School sparked a movement to end gun violence, especially in schools. I wa...tched and participated in protests. My peers, family, teachers, and neighbors did too. When it came to our public school system, Lexington was against the use of firearms.  Lexington Police Chief, Mark J. Corr emphasizes that “classroom and scenario training helps officers understanding WHEN and WHY force should be used.” (source link below) So as a Lexington youth, I have a right to know why $125,000 are being allocated to creating this plan, instead of non-violent police education and training?   We cannot pick and choose which parts to protest and support when it comes to gun violence. Changing the systemic gun violence in this country begins with our own community.  *If you agree with what's been said sign the petition at the top of this post* Presentation for Article 16a: https://www.lexingtonma.gov/…/article_16a_firing_range_a_4.… List of Lexington Reps who voted: https://www.lexingtonma.gov/…/article_16a_firing_range_a_4.…  Representative Contact List: http://www.lexingtontmma.org/pmwiki.php… Activism begins with education, so thank you to Nirmal Balachundhar for making me aware of this issue.

        "Hello everyone! My name is Jason and I’m looking to work with a few students this upcoming season. I debated for Syosset for 4 years, 1 and 1/2 in PF and 2 and 1/2 in LD. My senior year, I broke at nearly every tournament I went to, reaching a bid round, qualified for NYSFL (which didn’t happen b/c of corona), and competed on NY’s worlds team for NSDA, reaching outrounds. In addition, I mentored multiple small school students through various organizations like PepTalk, and pr...ivately, helping students earn one bid, break at multiple natcir tournaments, and champion trad/lay invites. I was a pretty flexible debater, and did everything imaginable throughout my career whether it be LARP, tricks and friv theory, or phil and K’s, and I’m down to coach debaters of all styles (this includes hard trad debaters). However, towards my senior year, I started focusing primarily on K and tricks debate. I usually read obscure positions and learned to explain them to a wide variety of judges, no matter their background (judge adaptation much wow). So if you’re a debater transitioning from trad to circuit, or looking to transition into reading dense philosophy/high theory, I’m definitely someone who can make it as easy as possible. If this interests you at all, don’t be afraid to reach out! Rates are negotiable and I promise that I don’t ask for very much. Send me a dm over messenger or an email to jasonlan16@gmail.com. Have a good one! See More"

But the horror extends beyond that. All the votes for the Senate and the House and local elections will also be gamed by this racket.  I have no doubt that the fix is already in, and the only way to stop it is to demand that the courts enforce in-person voting. The virus is just an excuse for this despica...ble deception. The church shutdown proves it. If they truly believe that the virus is as dangerous as they say it is, they would not have singled out the church for shutdown and have left big-box stores, bars, casinos, and marijuana outlets open. They used a big fat lie to close down our churches. Why? Because they hate the church. Now, we see the same lie being used to unleash the most heinous sabotage of our freedoms in American history. The argument that people shouldn’t go to polling places is destroyed by their actions. It’s the ultimate hypocrisy of the Left: leftist protesters—in person on the streets—protesting against in-person voting. How rich is that?

They made it their mission to ban prayer in public events, and even Friday night football. They are the ones who wanted the Ten Commandments taken down in every public park and building. They are the ones who banished Nativity displays at Christmas time. They hate our stand on marriage and abortion. They hate our beliefs. They make no pretense about it. ...There is zero outreach to Christians by Democrats. They are not even trying to get our vote, and gave up trying years ago. They have been tireless in their crusade to banish the influence of Christ on America. Long before Trump announced he would run for President, Obama was verbally belittling the Church. Then he openly went after ministries and Christian businesses that would not support abortion. In the last few months of his first term, he suspended Billy Graham’s nonprofit status. He weaponized the IRS to block conservative and Christian groups from getting non-profit status. All of this was before Trump. The caption below is no joke. It’s the absolute truth.

Back to the issue of cognitive decline. Below are his actual words as he addressed the coronavirus. Teleprompter and all. He has embraced the full compliment of socialist evil embedded in the Democrat platform. He wants Beto O’Rourke to take away our guns. He wants to reinstate laws that oppress Christian bakers and businesses. Not opinion. Things he has just said. He is so desperate to become President that he has vowed to veer left and rally those who support the agendas of Planned Parenthood, the LGBTQ activists, and socialism. He has even made a deal with the other devil, Bernie Sanders. China lied about Covid 19. That was a devastating attack on the United States. Joe Biden has made a career of giving in to the Chinese government. He even sided with them after the pandemic started accusing Trump of racism for stopping flights from China. Attacks from China are only beginning. That of itself makes Biden a disaster and the absolute worst choice. Joe Biden is the consort of Barack Obama, who has consistently been the most hostile President in history toward the Bible. How can you call yourself a Christian and vote for Joe Biden? He is too weak to resist Obama’s war on the church. He will serve at the behest of the worst enemies of both the church and the nation. He will go after every value Christianity stands for.

        "We had a pandemic that should have ignited reverence and repentance in Christians. But it didn’t. The big reason is modern preaching. That widespread moral confusion spills over into Christian sentiment about Biden. Here is my question: How can they call themselves Christians and do such an anti-Christian act as voting for Biden? The answer is simple: modern preaching. Modern preaching has produced the most Biblically illiterate generation of church-goers ever. Because of mod...ern preaching, Christians don’t know what they believe beyond their false vision of a loving, tolerant and generous God who caters to their every whim. A God to overlook their carnal lifestyle. Because of modern preaching a moral choice is not as important as ‘feeling loved.’ See More"

The phrase was ripped from those who meant well. But it is hijacked, perverted, and weaponized property. My brother and sister in the Lord, you are a fool to believe anything they say. I truly cannot understand how Christians—after all the proof—still chant “Black Lives Matter.” I don’t care that certain leaders of some ...Christian denominations insist we all say it. Their flimsy attempt at gaining acceptance does not turn wrong into right. The church has no business being a part of this fraudulent revolution, nor in its criminal destruction of our freedom. We should not be taking a knee. We should be taking a stand. Once more, I ask, “Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?

So far, the Mayor of Los Angeles has threatened to cut off the water and electricity of churches that stay open. The D.A. has told Che Ahn he is going to go to jail. A Judge has ordered both MacArthur and McCoy to show cause why they shouldn’t be punished. Here’s the question: There are thousands of churches in Los Angeles—a bevy of mega churches. Yet there is no ground-swell of outrage, no uprising of support, no push to stand with these men who are fighting for the church. And the same disheartening division exists all over America.

        "I believe the Pentecostal/Charismatic movement holds the greatest promise of catalyzing a national miracle. Specifically, because of the truth of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals have had the longest unbroken move of God in history. That is until now.  This movement is now weak, disoriented, divided, and rapidly losing relevance. It needs electrode paddles applied to her faintly beating heart. We were done in by our own version of a deep state. ... We were infiltrated. The engine that drove Spirit-filled momentum has been replaced.  A masterstroke of Satan—decades in its construction—worked to weaken many Spirit-filled leaders. Satan fooled leaders into replacing gold with bronze.  And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made. Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house (1 Kings 14:26).  The devil used craftiness to steal our gold. We removed mass soul-winning through the Holy Spirit. He tossed the bone of getting a big church to drooling leaders. We replaced revival with marketing and well-oiled, business entertainment centers. Grace is supposed to be a catalyst to holiness. A rampant new version of grace grants a license to lead a double life.  New Age nuances led many Spirit-filled Christians into out-of-Bible experiences. Never-never lands where emotional experiences and personal prophecies take supremacy over the Word of God.  The worst mistake was to stop teaching and leading people into the baptism of the Holy Spirit.  Most youth in Spirit-filled churches have never seen a miracle.  The result is an entire generation doesn’t know what they believe, why they believe it let alone possess authority to share it.  They embody Judges 2:10: “When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel.” See More"

        "Think about God. Think of the empires He has seen rise and fall. He has witnessed the destruction of many nations. He has overseen cultures that thought they would never die. Nineveh had a sign that read “the city that will always be.” Nahum the prophet reminded them of the great miracle they saw with Jonah as he foretold their delayed but certain doom. God has seen delusion before. Entitlement has never stopped judgment. America has an amazing history. We have been spared de...struction again and again by divine intervention. However, something has changed. This is the first time our culture started shaking its fist at Almighty God. We have crossed over into moral unchartered waters. We have an enemy we have never faced before—ourselves.  Abraham Lincoln said: “At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time or die by suicide.”1 Suicide is a big word. Suicide happens when life becomes too painful. Americans are in unbearable pain. Americans feel dread. Not since Lincoln have we been this divided. As voices drown one another out, millions in the middle truly wonder how long before destruction be our lot.  We are drowning in falsehoods. We can’t trust anything we hear in the media. And no one knows how dangerous that is because it has never happened before.  Few Americans make it through a day without alcohol, a toke, a pill, powder, or a needle. For heaven’s sake, our children are taking their own lives over shoes, pictures, texts, and messages on social media. Yet, few admit the direct correlation between our misery and rejection of God.  What can save us? Nothing less than a massive moral awakening. See More"

In this letter, Wesley confirms the urgency of divine certainty: “Unless God has raised you up for this very thing, you will be worn out by the opposition of men and devils. But if God be for you, who can be against you?  Are all of them together stronger than God? O be not weary of well doing! Go on, in the name of God and in... the power of his might…” Understand this child of God! The same Spirit that is awakening a passion and direction in you is doing the same thing to millions more. Soon an army will emerge that will invade every area of our culture. Today it is sporadic fire, here and there, but soon the prophetic core of God will obey and embrace their assignment. They will come together in a chorus of victory that will be unlike anything we have ever seen.

Not only that, but there will be a concerted effort to marginalize the church in ways you never imagined. Does that mean that Bible-based Christianity is over in America? Absolutely not! You watch: God will come out of nowhere to meet this threat. A big difference you will see in the coming leaders is where they serve. A few of them will be in pulpits. More of them will be in politics, bus...iness, science, law, entertainment, music, or a thousand other fields of endeavor.  They will not introduce subjects—they will introduce eras.   No one will be able to buy them off or get them to change the subject. They will operate on a disquieting plane of holiness and consecration. I believe A. W.

The two-vehicle accident occurred at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday on the Covington-Sawyer Road.... According to police, three Tahoma High School students were riding in one of the vehicles. One of the students, a 15-year-old girl, died at the scene. The other two students, 17-year-old boys, were injured and transported to hospitals. There were five people in the other vehicle and four of them were injured and transported to Harborview Medical Center. Police have not released names. The accident remains under investigation. We will do all that we can to support our students and staff as we grieve. School counselors are available to talk to students and offer support. Call 425-413-6204 to reach a counselor. We are also asking our community mental health partners for assistance and will update you about available resources. Let us all help, respect and care for each other as we deal with this terrible accident. The families of these students will need our support, but we should also respect their privacy.

Just a few scriptures to remind us what God says in the Holy Bible about greed.   1 Timothy 6:9(ESV) \"But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many  senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.\"... Ecclesiastes 5:10 (NIV) \"Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never  satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless.\" Matthew 19:24 (NLT) \"I'll say it again--it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle  than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!\" Money is power, influence, and overall wealth. Don't become so enamored with the possibilities money offers that you lose sight of what is truly important. 1 Corinthians 6:10 says that the greedy will not inherit the kingdom of God. Don't trade in your eternal blessing for temporary wealth. Hebrews 13:5 (NIV) \"Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you  have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.'\" 2 Corinthians 9:7 (NIV) \"Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not  reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\" Avoid greed by giving to others.  Since God has blessed you now be a blessing to someone else. See More"

        "Today we commemorate two martyrs of the Nazi Yoke, St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Jewish philosopher Edith Stein), and Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian conscientous objector, both cruelly executed by Hitler's vile regime. It is a commemoration very relevant to America today, beseiged as she is, in the Trump-led GOP death-cult, by an evil uncannily like unto that which spread throughout Germany on the 1930s and ended with millions of deaths, and which has already seen right... here the caging of tens of thousands in concentration camps, a vast unleashing of white supremacist violence both state-sponsored and privately led, federal secret police deployed against the citizenry, and a significant portion of the Church forsaking the incorruptible God in favor of Mammon, White Jesus, and the Invisible Hand. Ora pro nobis. «As a child of the Jewish people who, by the grace of God, for the past eleven years has also been a child of the Catholic Church, I dare to speak to the Father of Christianity about that which oppresses millions of Germans. For weeks we have seen deeds perpetrated in Germany which mock any sense of justice and humanity, not to mention love of neighbor. For years the leaders of National Socialism have been preaching hatred of the Jews. But the responsibility must fall, after all, on those who brought them to this point and it also falls on those who keep silent in the face of such happenings. Everything that happened and continues to happen on a daily basis originates with a government that calls itself \"Christian.\" For weeks not only Jews but also thousands of faithful Catholics in Germany, and, I believe, all over the world, have been waiting and hoping for the Church of Christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of Christ’s name.» – St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross READ: St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross https://ninthstation.blogspot.com/2018/08/st.html READ: Franz Jägerstätter: a solitary witness (Jim Forest) https://jimandnancyforest.com/2008/09/jagerstatter/ See More"

Centrist Democrats/Biden Republicans: \"Trump is really the one making us less safe. I love our police.\"  3. The right-wing TikTokers/\"Black Voices for Trump\" crowd: \"Checkmate. Biden is racist, but Trump will reduce the money available to hire cops, and I'll conveniently agree cops are bad. Remember those \"opportunity zones\" and lower unemployment.\" See More"

We all sat on some big r...ocks overlooking the lake. We talked amongst each other, showed photos of past adventures, laughed and enjoyed an easy and carefree environment I haven’t felt in months. Next thing the patriarch of the Asian American family busts out the Almond Roca and passes it around, insisting we all take a piece. Suddenly we’re all sharing snacks! A few younger folks jump in the water and we all clap. Not a mask in site. Happy Americans from all walks of life from young to old.

        "I agree 100%- so many whimsy churches, pastors and church goers. It’s embrassing to call yourself a faith filled church but not open because of fear or pressure. Both are not godly. Our church has grown from 150 to 1000 since Easter. NO FEAR- we trust and fear only one and that’s the Lord God almighty."

        "A profound feeling of loneliness tried to settle in on me today. A loneliness only to be matched by the bitter frustration of watching the disjointed American Church being so totally punked by billionaire frat boys. If calling you ‘chicken’ is what it takes to offend you and wake you up, dear leader, then, “Cluck, cluck.” My greatest agony is the fact that this war is so very winnable! We are a voice that can be so loud and so forceful. In fact, there is no movement in Americ...a—there is no lobby in America—there is no people group—with more firepower than the church. The fact is that if the churches in L.A. joined together and galvanized against the threat, it would end overnight. The idea that we are racist and hateful is preposterous.  But we do look like clowns when we accept that label and let it stop us. At this hour, God needs to apply the electrode paddles to the faintly beating heart of the American Church and jolt us back to our first love and fresh fire. It is time for us to hear the words of Nehemiah, and act on them: “And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses!”” (Nehemiah 4:14). Read more: https://bit.ly/3gl3icb See More"

        "Right now, in Los Angeles, notable pastors Che Ahn, John MacArthur, Rob McCoy, and Jack Hibbs are fighting the illegal closure of their churches. So far, the Mayor of Los Angeles has threatened to cut off the water and electricity of churches that stay open. The D.A. has told Che Ahn he is going to go to jail. A Judge has ordered both MacArthur and McCoy to show cause why they shouldn’t be punished. Here’s the question: There are thousands of churches in Los Angeles—a bevy of mega churches. Yet there is no ground-swell of outrage, no uprising of support, no push to stand with these men who are fighting for the church. And the same disheartening division exists all over America.

        "I met Josh and Dana in Everson through an R-90 signing event. They are on the front lines fighting for the victims in the sex trafficking trade.  It's important for us to recognize this issue is in our midst, but also to know about people serving in the trenches to help rescue victims right here in Whatcom County.  I was so impressed by their love and sincerity, I wanted you to meet them too. Dana Parriera - Advocacy Director at International Saints and Abolitionists: “Seven ...years ago, my husband went to Cambodia. Before he went, somebody said ‘Hey, you should look at this organization there and take a tour.’ So he goes on this tour, and it’s an organization that fights child sex trafficking and they do rescues and raids and rehabilitation, and he comes back ruined.   At first, I thought, ‘I can’t do this, it hits too much of a soft spot for me.’ But then I literally couldn’t sleep at night. It took some time, but after a while, I just realized, ‘I know it may be sensitive for me, but that makes me more passionate.’ And once my heart broke for it, I couldn’t stop myself. I care about the number of people who are getting pulled into the sex trade because it looks glamorous, but really it’s all a trap. The girls I know who are coming out of it, they are survivors and they are thrivers but it does so much damage to them, to their personhood. So three years ago, we decided to start our own organization that focuses on prevention and intervention in America by focusing on the Christian Church. We’re called International Saints and Abolitionists (ISA). My goal is to make advocates out of everybody. Everyone wants to stop sex trafficking but no one wants to learn about slavery. I think if people knew really what it is and what our sexual freedom is creating, I think they would question it. I delve into the research side. I interview sex-trafficked survivors so I can figure out what we’re missing. I’ve met some really awesome people. My interviews are three hours long but they sit down and they tell you their whole story and then all of a sudden we’re friends because I know their nitty-gritty and I love them anyway. https://www.saintsandabolitionists.com/ Thank you to Allyn Sims for her work on this feature.

        "Earlier this year I took a class on the American Revolution with one of my favorite history professors at Western. I learned a lot, and read some great books, but one thing stuck out to me.  Most people know that the Founders did not set out to declare independence. In fact they wanted to try and fix the problems they had with Great Britain, and continue the relationship as British Colonies. At some point however opinions shifted and independence became the preferred option. ...Some historians have said however that this shift was not top down as commonly believed, but bottom up. The average British subjects that had little power, and no political connections were the ones that influenced the people in Philadelphia with power. The PEOPLE finally said that they had enough, and that independence was what they wanted. I’ve heard a lot of people say the American Revolution was thought of and started by the powerful elite, but that is just not right, it was truly a revolution by the people.  On this day when there is so much negativity in this country, remember it’s origins in the PEOPLE. The United States is the greatest nation this world has ever seen, despite its faults, because of this founding principal. Happy Independence Day my friends 🇺🇸 See More"

        "Hello everyone! My name is Jason and I’m looking to work with a few students this upcoming season. I debated for Syosset for 4 years, 1 and 1/2 in PF and 2 and 1/2 in LD. My senior year, I broke at nearly every tournament I went to, reaching a bid round, qualified for NYSFL (which didn’t happen b/c of corona), and competed on NY’s worlds team for NSDA, reaching outrounds. In addition, I mentored multiple small school students through various organizations like PepTalk, and pr...ivately, helping students earn one bid, break at multiple natcir tournaments, and champion trad/lay invites. I was a pretty flexible debater, and did everything imaginable throughout my career whether it be LARP, tricks and friv theory, or phil and K’s, and I’m down to coach debaters of all styles (this includes hard trad debaters). However, towards my senior year, I started focusing primarily on K and tricks debate. I usually read obscure positions and learned to explain them to a wide variety of judges, no matter their background (judge adaptation much wow). So if you’re a debater transitioning from trad to circuit, or looking to transition into reading dense philosophy/high theory, I’m definitely someone who can make it as easy as possible. If this interests you at all, don’t be afraid to reach out! Rates are negotiable and I promise that I don’t ask for very much. Send me a dm over messenger or an email to jasonlan16@gmail.com. Have a good one! See More"

        "“These are the times that try men's [Citizen’s] souls.”  Apt  words from the pen of Revolutionary founder, Thomas Paine.  I guess this isn’t the first time our land has been in a dicey situation. I speak here as a person who believes that one may bend their knee to only one Master. For me, that Master is the Jesus of the Bible. And, I do place all other allegiances in a far lower category of my existence. At the same time, I am an American citizen, with all the due rights and... responsibilities of one who vows, “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands.” I bow to no president. But, I pledge full participation in this experiment in representative democracy that is a full system; greater than any one man. Let me remind all of my friends blue and red, that we are not about a President, but about a big idea and a big experiment (I believe Divinely-inspired experiment), wherein our forefathers sought to create a non-religiously run government, with full religious freedom; a durable form of government with checks and balances to keep it safe from “idiot kings and princes”.  So far, in spite of better and worse presidents, this idea of a representative system that reflects the consent of the governed has proven to have been pretty durable. I urge all colors, politically and otherwise to “stand in the place where you live” (thank you REM), yet engage others of different views by seeking understanding, seeking peace, operating in love and mercy. And, by all rights, vote for the people of your choice. Oppose poor ideas, but there is no room, to in any way, assault people for their views. It should be safe to go to any lecture. It should be safe to engage others in conversation, even passionate debate – and to do so without fear and with due respect. I don’t consider myself a coward or one lacking conviction when I call for “peace, love and understanding” (thank you Mr. Costello). I think this approach to decent civil discourse is our God-given and Constitutional right – and even more – our duty. If we don’t change our approach, “I see a bad moon arisin’” (Creedence) and to quote Bob Dylan “We don’t need a weatherman to see which way the wind blows”.  If we don’t change our course, we will be our own undoing! There is nothing funny about peace, love and understanding…and these three things coupled with a biblical writer’s notion of “faith, hope and love” as the things that endure are my hope and prayer for me, for you, for America and for the world. Big Love, Randy Rowland Seattle, Washington  Born in the USA See More"

        "Thank you, Everyone, for the many birthday wishes and posts.  It has been a crazy year and much is going on.  One positive, yet also sad, thing happening with me though, is that I have finally moved out of San Francisco and therefore also out of the Castro. 🌈 I didn’t want to ever leave the Castro as it has been a very special place for me to live, work, play, and volunteer in, but Sharlette Saldana and I have moved into a place together in San Bruno and I am excited to take ...this big step into the next chapter of living together. I’m not far and I’ll still be around the hood volunteering with Castro Patrol and hopefully teaching at CORE40 when we open back up again but I will miss being in the heart of the rainbow district where I’ve made so many friends and memories 🏳️‍🌈 looking forward to the new memories to be made in San Bruno.  One upside about moving though (besides living with Shar and all her stuffed animals) is I now FINALLY have space to open and use presents I’ve bought for myself (including the 14pc. Stainless steel pot/pan set, 18pc. Knife set, bamboo cutting board, and a dyson heater/fan/air purifier) or received from others over the years, as shown in the pictures. Some of these items I purchased as far back as 2014 waiting for this moment to open them 😈 I’ll also include a picture of the delicious birthday dinner Shar got from Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine  😋  Again, thank you everyone and remember to always treat others with kindness and empathy and please wear your mask in public places and wash or sanitize your hands thoroughly. Love you all! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤 See More"

        "A profound feeling of loneliness tried to settle in on me today. A loneliness only to be matched by the bitter frustration of watching the disjointed American Church being so totally punked by billionaire frat boys. If calling you ‘chicken’ is what it takes to offend you and wake you up, dear leader, then, “Cluck, cluck.” My greatest agony is the fact that this war is so very winnable! We are a voice that can be so loud and so forceful. In fact, there is no movement in Americ...a—there is no lobby in America—there is no people group—with more firepower than the church. The fact is that if the churches in L.A. joined together and galvanized against the threat, it would end overnight. The idea that we are racist and hateful is preposterous.  But we do look like clowns when we accept that label and let it stop us. At this hour, God needs to apply the electrode paddles to the faintly beating heart of the American Church and jolt us back to our first love and fresh fire. It is time for us to hear the words of Nehemiah, and act on them: “And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses!”” (Nehemiah 4:14). Read more: https://bit.ly/3gl3icb See More"

        "Leftist operatives man battle stations throughout the system that will count the votes. I will go so far as to say that mail-in ballots are Joe Biden’s only hope of winning. But the horror extends beyond that. All the votes for the Senate and the House and local elections will also be gamed by this racket.  I have no doubt that the fix is already in, and the only way to stop it is to demand that the courts enforce in-person voting. The virus is just an excuse for this despica...ble deception. The church shutdown proves it. If they truly believe that the virus is as dangerous as they say it is, they would not have singled out the church for shutdown and have left big-box stores, bars, casinos, and marijuana outlets open. They used a big fat lie to close down our churches. Why? Because they hate the church. Now, we see the same lie being used to unleash the most heinous sabotage of our freedoms in American history. The argument that people shouldn’t go to polling places is destroyed by their actions. It’s the ultimate hypocrisy of the Left: leftist protesters—in person on the streets—protesting against in-person voting. How rich is that?  Think voter fraud is not being planned on a massive scale consider 20,000 fake driver’s licenses… Read more: https://bit.ly/2YDTog7 See More"

Currently, I have some experience but I've mainly been in like traditional debates, I need a lot of help with teaching me different argument skills and different types of arguments. I'm looking to debate in the nat circuit, I have some basic knowledge on stuff like cps disads, theory, t, and little about the k...,, I know the structure for that and that's about it.  I'm looking for someone to do 2 main things with me,  a. teach me more stuff like different types of arguments how to run stuff, so basically just like help me learn more advanced stuff I'm also looking to do drills, (I need a lot of help with skills inn this department) I'm not looking for stuff like cutting me cards or finding evidence, I just want to improve as like a general debater instead of like slight strength in a specific topic. I'd like someone with a good amount of experience in coaching since I think that'll be better for someone less experienced like me, also more on the cheaper side instead of the insanely expensive debate coaches out there. I'm looking to grind debate all the way to senior year and maybe even college, but I'm willing to work really hard in debate.

        "Hello everyone! My name is Jason and I’m looking to work with a few students this upcoming season. I debated for Syosset for 4 years, 1 and 1/2 in PF and 2 and 1/2 in LD. My senior year, I broke at nearly every tournament I went to, reaching a bid round, qualified for NYSFL (which didn’t happen b/c of corona), and competed on NY’s worlds team for NSDA, reaching outrounds. In addition, I mentored multiple small school students through various organizations like PepTalk, and pr...ivately, helping students earn one bid, break at multiple natcir tournaments, and champion trad/lay invites. I was a pretty flexible debater, and did everything imaginable throughout my career whether it be LARP, tricks and friv theory, or phil and K’s, and I’m down to coach debaters of all styles (this includes hard trad debaters). However, towards my senior year, I started focusing primarily on K and tricks debate. I usually read obscure positions and learned to explain them to a wide variety of judges, no matter their background (judge adaptation much wow). So if you’re a debater transitioning from trad to circuit, or looking to transition into reading dense philosophy/high theory, I’m definitely someone who can make it as easy as possible. If this interests you at all, don’t be afraid to reach out! Rates are negotiable and I promise that I don’t ask for very much. Send me a dm over messenger or an email to jasonlan16@gmail.com. Have a good one! See More"

All approved judges will be paid $25 per flight they judge, up to a cap of $150 per day. Approved judges will be paid a minimum of $75 per day they are available.... Tab will make efforts to not place judges for all 8 flights in any given day to reduce the impact of zoom fatigue on the judge pool. To Summarize: 0-3 flights judged = $75 4 flights = $100 5 flights = $125 6-8 flights = $150 These flight counts reset each day. Thus the minimum a 3-day available judge will make is $225 and the maximum is $450 Interested individuals should fill out this form ASAP.

        "Hey everyone, I'm a LD debater at a school in Wisconsin. I started debating freshman year and I'm an upcoming sophomore. I'm looking for someone to coach me year round. Currently, I have some experience but I've mainly been in like traditional debates, I need a lot of help with teaching me different argument skills and different types of arguments. I'm looking to debate in the nat circuit, I have some basic knowledge on stuff like cps disads, theory, t, and little about the k...,, I know the structure for that and that's about it.  I'm looking for someone to do 2 main things with me,  a. teach me more stuff like different types of arguments how to run stuff, so basically just like help me learn more advanced stuff I'm also looking to do drills, (I need a lot of help with skills inn this department) I'm not looking for stuff like cutting me cards or finding evidence, I just want to improve as like a general debater instead of like slight strength in a specific topic. I'd like someone with a good amount of experience in coaching since I think that'll be better for someone less experienced like me, also more on the cheaper side instead of the insanely expensive debate coaches out there. I'm looking to grind debate all the way to senior year and maybe even college, but I'm willing to work really hard in debate. Dm me on messenger if you can talk to me about coaching, that'd be really nice. See More"

        "On July 21st, my grandmother passed away. It was hard to see her in so much pain during her last few weeks of life. Sometimes when we would video call her, she could barely stay awake to say hello. Eventually, she was being hydrated, fed, and given oxygen though tubes. However, I hate remembering her like  that. Instead, I choose to remember her for the remarkable woman she was. When I was a child, she came to Texas to visit us. Her and my Lolo Pete took care of us, played wi...th us, and showered us in so much love. I eat my sweet potatoes mashed with butter and cream because that’s the way she made them for me. She wanted us to be sage and would also watch us when we would swim in the pool, even though my sister and I already knew how to swim. Lola was a large part of my childhood and left me with so many wonderful memories.  During the last few months, Lola would sometimes forget who and my sister were. However, she took the extra effort to speak to my sister and I in English because we couldn’t speak to her in Ilocano. It warms my heart that even in her old age, she tried hard to connect and communicate with me. The last time I called her, I remember her being very tired and sleepy. Despite that, she still woke up to tell me hello and how much she loved me. Lola always said, “love you todo todo, no preno”, which roughly translates to “I love you with no brakes”. She truly loved me, even though I was halfway across the world and couldn’t see her in person often. Djanaya and I would not be able to make it to the funeral, but we wanted to find some way to honor her memory. We took these photos to have one last memory with our Lola and lit candles in her honor. I wish there are to describe how much I’m going to miss her and how much I love her. All I can say is, “Lola, I love you todo with no preno”. See More"

Currently, I have some experience but I've mainly been in like traditional debates, I need a lot of help with teaching me different argument skills and different types of arguments. I'm looking to debate in the nat circuit, I have some basic knowledge on stuff like cps disads, theory, t, and little about the k...,, I know the structure for that and that's about it.  I'm looking for someone to do 2 main things with me,  a. teach me more stuff like different types of arguments how to run stuff, so basically just like help me learn more advanced stuff I'm also looking to do drills, (I need a lot of help with skills inn this department) I'm not looking for stuff like cutting me cards or finding evidence, I just want to improve as like a general debater instead of like slight strength in a specific topic. I'd like someone with a good amount of experience in coaching since I think that'll be better for someone less experienced like me, also more on the cheaper side instead of the insanely expensive debate coaches out there. I'm looking to grind debate all the way to senior year and maybe even college, but I'm willing to work really hard in debate. Dm me on messenger if you can talk to me about coaching, that'd be really nice. See More"

One was a spring of hope, the other a nuclear winter of despair. Fear and hate ruled in one venue. Courage and love in the other. Democrats carted out the waxworks. The usual suspects. Political-lifers, hacks, and traitors. Men and women festering in old bitterness, demonizing everything American. Bashing patriotism. Removing God. Even the American flag was banned.

I also get the cheap and easy acceptance readily available from the Left, and the stigma attached to standing against peer pressure. But remember, President Trump stands with all evangelical Christians and supports Israel. He deserves your support. Why would you side with the enemies of America and God by voting against him? I am not saying that Trump is a ‘type’ of Christ, but what I am saying is that Chr...ist was a deliverance that the Jews found offensive. When Jesus saw that they despised their own deliverance He wept. “Now as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it, saying, “If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things that make for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and close you in on every side, and level you, and your children within you, to the ground; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation” Luke 19:41-44).

Look at the statistics and you will come to an unavoidable conclusion: Crime, rioting, looting, and fires are almost the exclusive domain of Democrat controlled cities. But that is not the most alarming part. They will not stop the thugs who are posing as revolutionaries from destroying private property and even killing innocent A...mericans. When asked about the rioting and the killing, Nancy Pelosi said, “Well. People will do what they will do.” In other words, if people don’t want it, it shouldn’t be there. Innocent Americans have lost their lives, trapped in these fires, riots and lootings. Trump wants to protect them, but the Democrats accuse him of being a dictator, because he wants to rescue them.

Trump, Pence, and their surrogates are trying to convince voters that Trump, a strongman, would be able to round up and jail protesters with military force. The wish that protesters would stay home and that everyone submit to God and country (\"Biden hates God,\" or Pence saying \"the election is about whether Ame...rica stays America\") is authoritarian propaganda that enables the paramilitary violence committed by the Proud Boys, or militia members like Kyle Rittinghouse. \"Back the Blue\" groups, whose members use semiautomatic rifles to kill and injure protesters in the name of defending the authorities, are becoming increasingly similar to the German Freikorps, paramilitary units that - with government approval - had beaten and killed Communists after World War One.  Of course, if \"law-and-order\" just means \"Send in the National Guard to hang around in case someone dies, but respect people's First Amendment rights,\" Biden would be doing that if he were president anyway, so there's no evidence he'd make cities \"less safe.\" See More"
