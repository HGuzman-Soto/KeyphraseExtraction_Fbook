I’m Zac Davis and I’m looking to coach and judge for students this debate season,So you’re probably wondering why you should consider me:As a debater I was successful on the national circuit and qualified to the TOC twice despite lacking a school debate coach or strong institutional support, going 3-3 as a Junior and choosing to coach rather than attend Corona-toc. Other notable results include a positive record at NSDAs being ranked 6th in California by the NSDA, and bei...ng a runner up at the Apple Valley RR, winning the VBI Varsity tournament and reaching quarterfinals at RKS’s Varsity tournament.However, not all good debaters are good teachers. I’ve always placed heavy emphasis on a strong foundation so I focused on research and understanding the philosophy behind the arguments I read. This philosophy transfers heavily into my coaching style. I want to enable students, not think for them.  I have experience coaching 40+ debaters for Policy, LD, and Parliamentary debate and have worked with programs such as PepTalk, W.indebate, ODI, VBI, UTNIF, and currently Triumph Debate. While I was still debating I founded and organized Verge Debate, a mutual prep sharing and coaching team for small school debaters without school coaches, and so I have lots of experience coordinating prep assignments, talking about strategies, and assisting with long term and pre-round preparation and a majority of our members reached TOC for the first time as Verge members. I am familiar with overcoming prep disparities, organizing collaboration in drills mocks and prep assignments, and providing specialized and flexible support to different debaters needs. Over the summer alone I’ve judged 40+ rounds, so I have plenty of experience working online and in-depth knowledge of modern debate trends. In summary I’m incredibly passionate about debate content and strategy and have the experience to back it up.For those already on the circuit:I specialized in theory das and ks, but have lots of experience innovating phil and larp/policy positions as well. Whether you are looking to understand the literature behind a dense kritik or learn how to do a 1AR vs 7 off, I can help! Reach out for any more details about argumentative specifics.In Conclusion:Beyond my debate and coaching experience I want to emphasize coaching goes beyond that. While my debaters certainly will sharpen their debate skills, I emphasize even more importantly the value of presentation, conversation, and research skills debate teaches, which have benefited other aspects of my life such as academics and organization. Additionally, I encourage debaters to learn more about politics and form their own opinions and develop critical thinking skills to help make the ideas they persuade others of are good ones. I care about the emotional wellbeing of the debaters I coach, and will modify drill schedules around mental health and help coach students through tough losses.Sorry I know the pitch is long feel free to read as little or much I just want you to have access to info about me before making your decision about coaching, and if you are on the fence I recommend you reach out to students and organizations I've worked with or are working with for more information about my coaching style.Here are some emails, reach out to me if you want more.Sarah Zheng from Dulles pandazh13@gmail.comLukas Krause from Mitty lukrauwork@gmail.comOlivia He from Quarry Lane oxh38389@gmail.comDirector of LD Debate at UTNIF sunhee.simon@gmail.comODI Admin and Co-Lab Leader for Top Lab pdfox0513@gmail.comDirector of Triumph triumphdebate@gmail.comManaging Director and Head of HR of Victory Briefs Institute anthony@victorybriefs.comI hope you want to work with me in the future, and best of luck debating!Please reach out to me via pm or zacjudges@gmail.com if interested.I’m also looking to be hired to judge at any TOC bid distributing tournaments throughout the year so reach out if you need one.

I will go so far as to say that mail-in ballots are Joe Biden’s only hope of winning. But the horror extends beyond that. All the votes for the Senate and the House and local elections will also be gamed by this racket.  I have no doubt that the fix is already in, and the only way to stop it is to demand that the courts enforce in-person voting. The virus is just an excuse for this despica...ble deception. The church shutdown proves it. If they truly believe that the virus is as dangerous as they say it is, they would not have singled out the church for shutdown and have left big-box stores, bars, casinos, and marijuana outlets open. They used a big fat lie to close down our churches. Why? Because they hate the church. Now, we see the same lie being used to unleash the most heinous sabotage of our freedoms in American history. The argument that people shouldn’t go to polling places is destroyed by their actions. It’s the ultimate hypocrisy of the Left: leftist protesters—in person on the streets—protesting against in-person voting. How rich is that?  Think voter fraud is not being planned on a massive scale consider 20,000 fake driver’s licenses… Read more: https://bit.ly/2YDTog7 See More",Thank you for reading and sharing! Why not demand bipartisan handlers present for any volunteers that are involved with  ballots or collections in any way? We need accountability for all ballots sent out and collected.

I care about the number of people who are getting pulled into the sex trade because it looks glamorous, but really it’s all a trap. The girls I know who are coming out of it, they are survivors and they are thrivers but it does so much damage to them, to their personhood. So three years ago, we decided to start our own organization that focuses on prevention and intervention in America by focusing on the Christian Church. We’re called International Saints and Abolitionists (ISA). My goal is to make advocates out of everybody. Everyone wants to stop sex trafficking but no one wants to learn about slavery. I think if people knew really what it is and what our sexual freedom is creating, I think they would question it. I delve into the research side. I interview sex-trafficked survivors so I can figure out what we’re missing. I’ve met some really awesome people. My interviews are three hours long but they sit down and they tell you their whole story and then all of a sudden we’re friends because I know their nitty-gritty and I love them anyway. https://www.saintsandabolitionists.com/ Thank you to Allyn Sims for her work on this feature.

Let me remind all of my friends blue and red, that we are not about a President, but about a big idea and a big experiment (I believe Divinely-inspired experiment), wherein our forefathers sought to create a non-religiously run government, with full religious freedom; a durable form of government with checks and balances to keep it safe from “idiot kings and princes”.  So far, in spite of better and worse presidents, this idea of a representative system that reflects the consent of the governed has proven to have been pretty durable.

It should be safe to engage others in conversation, even passionate debate – and to do so without fear and with due respect.
