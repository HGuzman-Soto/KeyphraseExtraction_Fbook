And      I honestly believe that Gilles Deleuze is best situated for rethinking the social issues one is hoping to change.  In Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze, together with F√©lix Guattari, moved beyond philosophical critique to creation and affirmation of new forms of thought and life, providing a rich source of concepts for re-thinking the social world. In their last collaborated work, 'What is Philosophy?', Deleuze and Guattari shift their focus back to philosophy and its role in effecting revolutionary social change. For Deleuze and Guattari, the aim of philosophy is the creation of concepts which enable something new to be thought or felt. Such concepts have the power, when inserted into concrete fields or assemblages, to produce a change in that field; a change which may in turn lead to other, potentially revolutionary changes. Philosophical theory, in a sense, is not something with which to understand the social, nor is it something which is to be proven true or false. The question is not whether a particular concept is 'true', but whether it works, and whether it opens up the range of possibilities in a given situation. I believe that Gilles Deleuze can inspire in us a general openness to encounters that shift the ground from under us and disrupt established ways of being: encounters that call forth a social yet to come . . .", "json_obj": ""}, {"Post": "Beautiful üçí 2017 Honda CB500X motorcycle for Sale. $4000 OBO.
