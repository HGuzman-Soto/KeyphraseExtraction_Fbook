       "'i remember my first student evaluations 1 more short skirts 2 your hair looks so much better down 3 the psych building is too far away from my dorm room i decided at this point that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my teaching kristy m keefe my first semester teaching i got two comments saying to wear less clothes as a new instructor this was not what i was expecting and not helpful in how i could improve as an educator sadly this may have been the first time i received comments about my appearance but it was not the last ugh thats sexual harassment i got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt literally kristy m keefe i had the opposite for the hair my hair is long and i always wear it down student said that i either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is unprofessional students will reach for anything when they want to be negative one time a student asked me a question about the midterm and i said i hadnt finished it yet they mentioned that in my rmp rating lol like they never procrastinate amanda carroll were you tempted to clap back with do you mean fewer these sites are just nonsense appalling levels of sexual harassment and not just against women ive known male teachers have similarly inappropriate comments posted kristy m keefe for sure amanda greubel nope i have also had some wonderfully thoughtful comments about my courses ill take the bad with the good angry people en route joshua shinn how dare youim not angry i just hate to disappoint anyone being a good prof doesnt hurt either michael w hitch i had this one professor back in my college days that was without a doubt the best professor i ever had his rmp ratings were trashed because he wasnt an easy a a lot of us couldnt believe it because we loved him and he asked if michael w hitch dude it doesnt matter for some of us christ being a good professor has nothing to do with good evaluations and i would go so far to say that the effective professor does not get good reviews do be glib though woosh my teaching reviews like my article reviews fell neatly into thirds one third fantastic no improvement needed one third ok but one third who let this idiot leave his village i suffered a bit because my undergrad subject was a demanding the person paying for the service should be the one to decide how that service should be evaluatedif they want to judge it on financial merit or educational merit or social merit its up to them stephen cooper setting aside the sneer in your comment my point was of course that the principle of having ones teaching evaluated is fine but the execution ends up failing its purpose i doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the my favorite criticism from a student on rmp every other professor wants you to succeed she only cares about how much you learn the rest of the review made clear that success was just about a specific letter gradestudent evals usually tell us more about students than about teachers my favorite criticism on a student eval she doesnt teach us the content she expects us to learn it ourselves apparently the fact that i dont lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isnt good teaching _ no kiddinyou mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest ill be damned youre not wrong tenure attractive any day promote these large nostrils and heavy baggaged eyes please i wont lie the chili peppers are from my nephews should i remind that correlation does not mean causation innokenty kantor you seem to assume that universities hire more poorly qualified nonwhite nonmales over better qualified white males whereas in reality the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against people who are innokenty kantor thanks for explaining my comment for me yes because being male or white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges the way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face bias jacq jones not at all i think it is the opposite those who think that any disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination are just burying their heads in sand because they dont like the implications ransell dsouza he was trying to write of course in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as of cause notice he also replaced the word hire with high its probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof innokenty kantor unless you are already hiring inferior candidates who happen to fit your bias eg white men in which case expanded the range of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires whats of cause innokenty kantor yes its nice apologies for not getting reference id love to see this extended to include racial bias because sadly i think this would be even more pronounced and the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at best innokenty kantor there seems to be a strong correlation that white men dont believe academia is sexist and racist backed up by several studies seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their existing culture which is really just code for biases towards wht they think ideal candidates are like and the issues with the methodology but not news i dont even look anymore you must not be an adjunct i dont want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs i apply to every year well i get three out of four thats how i do it wait there are adults who actually care about whats written on ratemyprofessor no of you should ever under any circumstances read rate my professor no good comes of it and i firmly believe there should be a rate my student site mirrors typical life i dont bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage ditto especially after reading a rape fantasy i hope you reported that bob borrelli why so they can all laugh about it pick up lines graphic sexual fantasies sexual assault and notes like pretty sure i found your house were totally ignored tashana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you you brought it to our attention years ago white yes male no tenured hahaha attractive um brenna e culbert my favorite comment on rmp was she has a lot of patience even with the stupid question people amanda evert they repeated your study sarina kilham thanks adding it to my stockpile of evidence hadil ghoneim here you go im attractive though white yes male yes tenured no attractive not really my rmp ratings still suck although i have a few good ones jess moore the most frequent descriptor people use for me is boring that one cuts me to my soul im fun brian paul i agree and my ratings are largely good and even the negative ones are worthwhile brian paul i just got a bad review for giving too much work for a minimester class im not even sure how to take that am i supposed to assign less work during a minimester i was told youre supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now i wonder about that aurora le well shit ami sedani new study more like duh lol lisa parker lebovitz daniel malcom thanks ive got to get back to the data i think we can refute this maybe the young white male faculty arent as attractive to students in pharmacy as in humanities francesca bosisio my favourite bit of feedback received from a student who scored my course a 0please can there be better references not of those written ages ago when they used sophisticated wordscause who comes to university to learn sophisticated words lets harry green brilliant bob borrelli yeah fuck that guy and his sophisticated words d who literally invented meteorology hey can you link the math paper using emoji that would be awesome and id like to read itthis is a good one about emoji but its not written in it though it has some examples of retelling https well i am an unattractive white female and get great reviews and teach a subject that is considered hard perhaps it would be profitable to spend some time studying statistics you fulfill one of the categories then goodforyou i see you dont understand how studies work a study never reports that in 100 of cases this happens and in 0 of cases this happened if that were true providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the studystudies look at the way things tend to be maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but its not a guarantee one way or the other still funny race and gender are less important than attractiveness student interest and discipline but the first two features in the headline is white and male stop contradicting the facts with your divisive ideology juan trucupey cool story bro catherine glass its easy to laugh when youre the beneficiary juan trucupey thats not contradicting facts its emphasising some things that the study found more than others but i bet the standard of attractiveness and gender interact as well juan yes its all propaganda its not like theyre just pointing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the obvious ones student interest in the subject influences professor ratings really juan trucupey youre the one who is claiming that it is sexist against males to imply that gender affects ratings before listing a students interest in the subject matter i never said that so your complaint that im contradicting myself is wrong propaganda lol i literally have had female students look for profs who are called a bitch it apparently means something different to people good to know those students just graduating with phds now one went to georgetown another is a teacher

and not just against women ive known <b><u>male teachers</u></b> have similarly <b><u>inappropriate comments</u></b> posted <b><u>kristy m keefe</u></b> for <b><u>sure amanda greubel</u></b> nope i have also had some wonderfully <b><u>thoughtful comments</u></b> about my courses ill take the bad with the <b><u><b><u>good</u></b> angry <b><u>people</u></b></u></b> en <b><u>route joshua

<b><u>professor</u></b> back in my college days that was without a doubt the <b><u>best <b><u>professor</u></b></u></b> i ever had his rmp ratings were trashed because he wasnt an easy a a lot of us couldnt believe it because we loved him and he asked if wsee <b><u>more</u></b> <b><u><b><u>michael w hitch</u></b> dude</u></b> it doesnt matter for some of us christ being a

<b><u>financial merit</u></b> or <b><u>educational merit</u></b> or <b><u>social merit</u></b> its up to them see <b><u><b><u>more</u></b> stephen cooper</u></b> setting aside the sneer in your comment my point was of course that the principle of having ones teaching evaluated is fine but the execution ends up failing its purpose i doubt that <b><u>such evaluations</u></b> are even a <b><u><b><u>good</u></b> test</u></b> of the studsee <b><u>more</u></b> my favorite criticism from a <b><u>student</u></b> on rmp every <b><u>other <b><u>professor</u></b></u></b> wants you to succeed she only cares about how much you learn the rest of the <b><u>review</u></b> made clear that success was just about a specific letter grade<b><u><b><u>student</u></b> eval</u></b>s usually tell us <b><u>more</u></b> about <b><u>student</u></b>s than about teachers my favorite criticism on a <b><u><b><u>student</u></b> eval</u></b> she doesnt teach us the content she expects us to learn it ourselves apparently the fact that i dont lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isnt <b><u><b><u>good</u></b> teaching _</u></b> no kiddinyou mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest ill be damned youre not wrong tenure attractive any day promote these large nostrils and <b><u>heavy baggaged eyes</u></b> please i wont lie the chili peppers are from my nephews should i remind that correlation does not mean causation innokenty kantor you seem to assume that universities hire <b><u>more</u></b> poorly qualified non<b><u>white</u></b> nonmales over <b><u>better qualified <b><u>white</u></b> males</u></b> whereas in reality the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against <b><u>people</u></b> who are <b><u>more</u></b>see <b><u>more</u></b> <b><u>innokenty kantor thanks</u></b> for explaining my comment for me yes because being male or <b><u>white</u></b> has never been shown to be the <b><u>direct cause</u></b> of very tangible privileges the way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face <b><u>bias jacq jones</u></b> not at all i think it is the opposite those who think that any disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination are just burying their heads in sand because they dont like the implications ransell dsouza he was trying to write of course in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as of <b><u>cause notice</u></b> he also replaced the word hire with high its probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof innokenty kantor unless you are already hiring <b><u>inferior candidates</u></b> who happen to fit your <b><u>bias eg <b><u><b><u>white</u></b> men</u></b></u></b> in which case expanded the range of <b><u>people</u></b> you consider will enhance the quality of your hires whats of cause innokenty kantor yes its nice apologies for not getting reference id love to see this extended to include <b><u>racial bias</u></b> because sadly i think this would be even <b><u>more</u></b> pronounced and the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at <b><u>best innokenty kantor</u></b> there seems to be a strong correlation that <b><u><b><u>white</u></b> men</u></b> dont believe academia is sexist and racist backed up by <b><u>several studies</u></b> seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the <b><u>best candidate</u></b> rather than the one that most closely matches their existing culture which is really just code for biases towards wht they think <b><u>ideal candidates</u></b> are like and the <b><u>dsee <b><u>more</u></b> issues</u></b> with the methodology but not news i dont even look any<b><u>more</u></b> you must not be an adjunct i dont want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs i apply to every year well i get three out of four thats how i do it wait there are adults who actually care about whats written on ratemy<b><u>professor</u></b> no of you should ever under any circumstances read rate my <b><u>professor</u></b> no <b><u>good</u></b> comes of it and i firmly believe there should be a rate my <b><u><b><u>student</u></b> site</u></b> mirrors

can all laugh about it pick up <b><u>lines graphic sexual fantasies sexual assault</u></b> and notes like pretty sure i found your house were totally ignored tashana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you you brought it to our attention years ago <b><u>white</u></b> yes male no <b><u>tenured hahaha attractive</u></b> um <b><u>brenna e culbert</u></b> my <b><u>favorite comment</u></b> on

for a minimester class im not even sure how to take that am i supposed to assign <b><u>less work</u></b> during a minimester i was told youre supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now i wonder about that aurora le well <b><u>shit ami sedani new study</u></b> <b><u>more</u></b> like duh <b><u>lol lisa parker lebovitz daniel malcom thanks</u></b> ive got to get back to the

aside the sneer in your comment my <b><u>point</u></b> was of course that the <b><u>principle</u></b> of having <b><u>ones</u></b> <b><u>teaching</u></b> evaluated is fine but the execution ends up failing its purpose i doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the studsee more my <b><u>favorite criticism</u></b> from a student on rmp every other <b><u>professor</u></b> wants you to succeed she only cares about how <b><u>much</u></b> you learn the rest of the review made <b><u>clear</u></b> that <b><u>success</u></b> was just about a specific letter gradestudent evals usually tell us more about students than about <b><u>teachers</u></b> my <b><u>favorite criticism</u></b> on a student eval she doesnt teach us the content she expects us to learn it ourselves apparently the <b><u>fact</u></b> that i dont lecture from the text and expect them to come to <b><u>class</u></b> having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isnt good <b><u>teaching</u></b> _ no kiddinyou mean a <b><u>popularity contest</u></b> turns out to be like a <b><u>popularity contest</u></b> ill be damned youre not <b><u>wrong tenure</u></b> attractive any day promote these <b><u>large nostrils</u></b> and heavy baggaged eyes please i wont lie the chili peppers are from my nephews should i remind that <b><u>correlation</u></b> does not mean <b><u>causation</u></b> innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> you seem to assume that <b><u>universities</u></b> hire more poorly qualified non<b><u>white</u></b> nonmales over <b><u>better</u></b> qualified <b><u>white</u></b> males whereas in <b><u>reality</u></b> the whole <b><u>point</u></b> of <b><u>diversity practices</u></b> in <b><u>hiring</u></b> is to mitigate <b><u>bias</u></b> against people who are <b><u>moresee</u></b> more innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> thanks for explaining my comment for me yes because being male or <b><u>white</u></b> has never been shown to be the <b><u>direct cause</u></b> of very <b><u>tangible privileges</u></b> the <b><u>way</u></b> some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face <b><u>bias</u></b> jacq j<b><u>ones</u></b> not at all i think it is the <b><u>opposite</u></b> those who think that any disproportion is a <b><u>result</u></b> of <b><u>bias</u></b> or <b><u>discrimination</u></b> are just burying their <b><u>heads</u></b> in sand because they dont like the implications ransell dsouza he was trying to write of course in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as of cause notice he also replaced the <b><u>word</u></b> hire with high its probably a <b><u>combination</u></b> of using <b><u>autocorrect</u></b> and a <b><u>complete lack</u></b> of <b><u>proof</u></b> innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> unless you are already <b><u>hiring</u></b> <b><u>inferior candidates</u></b> who happen to fit your <b><u>bias</u></b> eg <b><u>white</u></b> men in which <b><u>case</u></b> expanded the <b><u>range</u></b> of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires whats of cause innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> yes its <b><u>nice apologies</u></b> for not getting reference id love to see this extended to include racial <b><u>bias</u></b> because sadly i think this would be even more pronounced and the weighting often put on these for tenure is <b><u>problematic</u></b> at best innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> there seems to be a strong <b><u>correlation</u></b> that <b><u>white</u></b> men dont believe <b><u>academia</u></b> is <b><u>sexist</u></b> and <b><u>racist</u></b> backed up by <b><u>several studies</u></b> seems to <b><u>point</u></b> to a causality of their <b><u>fear</u></b> of losing <b><u>status</u></b> in a field <b><u>bias</u></b>ed towards them the most <b><u>laughable part</u></b> is the <b><u>assumption</u></b> that <b><u>universities</u></b> hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their existing culture which is really just code for <b><u>bias</u></b>es towards wht they think ideal candidates are like and the dsee more issues with the methodology but not news i dont even look anymore you must not be an adjunct i dont want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs i apply to every <b><u>year</u></b> well i get three out of four thats how i do it wait there are adults who actually care about whats written on <b><u>rate</u></b>my<b><u>professor</u></b> no of you should ever under any circumstances read <b><u>rate</u></b> my <b><u>professor</u></b> no good comes of it and i firmly believe there should be a <b><u>rate</u></b> my student site mirrors typical life i dont bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage ditto especially after reading a rape fantasy i hope you reported that bob borrelli why so they can all laugh about it pick up lines graphic sexual fantasies sexual assault and notes like pretty sure i found your house were totally ignored tashana this <b><u>kind</u></b> of stuff al<b><u>way</u></b>s makes me think of you you brought it to our attention <b><u>year</u></b>s ago <b><u>white</u></b> yes male no <b><u>tenured hahaha attractive</u></b> um brenna e culbert my favorite comment on rmp was she has a <b><u>lot</u></b> of patience even with the stupid question people amanda evert they repeated your study sarina kilham thanks adding it to my stockpile of evidence hadil ghoneim here you go im attractive though <b><u>white</u></b> yes male yes tenured no attractive not really my rmp ratings still suck although i have a few good <b><u>ones</u></b> jess moore the most frequent descriptor people use for me is boring that one cuts me to my soul im <b><u>fun brian paul</u></b> i agree and my ratings are largely good and even the <b><u>negative</u></b> <b><u>ones</u></b> are worthwhile brian paul i just got a <b><u>bad</u></b> review for giving too <b><u>much</u></b> work for a minimester <b><u>class</u></b> im not even sure how to take that am i supposed to assign less work during a minimester i was told youre supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now i wonder about that aurora le well shit ami sedani new study more like duh lol lisa parker lebovitz daniel malcom thanks ive got to get back to the data i think we can refute this maybe the young <b><u>white</u></b> male faculty arent as attractive to students in <b><u>pharmacy</u></b> as in <b><u>humanities francesca bosisio</u></b> my favourite <b><u>bit</u></b> of <b><u>feedback</u></b> received from a student who scored my course a 0please can there be <b><u>better</u></b> references not of those written ages ago when they used sophisticated <b><u>word</u></b>scause who comes to university to learn sophisticated <b><u>word</u></b>s lets usee more harry green brilliant bob borrelli yeah fuck that guy and his sophisticated <b><u>word</u></b>s d who literally invented meteorology hey can you link the math paper using <b><u>emoji</u></b> that would be awesome and id like to read itthis is a good one about <b><u>emoji</u></b> but its not written in it though it has some examples of retelling https well i am an unattractive <b><u>white</u></b> female and get great reviews and teach a subject that is considered hard perhaps it would be profitable to spend some <b><u>time</u></b> studying statistics you fulfill one of the categories then goodforyou i see you dont understand how studies work a study never reports that in 100 of <b><u>case</u></b>s this happens and in 0 of <b><u>case</u></b>s this happened if that were true providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the studystudies look at the <b><u>way</u></b> things tend to be maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but its not a <b><u>guarantee</u></b> one <b><u>way</u></b> or the other still <b><u>funny race</u></b> and <b><u>gender</u></b> are less <b><u>important</u></b> than attractiveness student interest and <b><u>discipline</u></b> but the first two <b><u>features</u></b> in the <b><u>headline</u></b> is <b><u>white</u></b> and male stop contradicting the <b><u>fact</u></b>s with your divisive ideology juan trucupey cool story bro catherine glass its <b><u>easy</u></b> to laugh when youre the <b><u>beneficiary juan trucupey</u></b> thats not contradicting <b><u>fact</u></b>s its emphasising some things that the study found more than others but i bet the standard of attractiveness and <b><u>gender</u></b> interact as well juan yes its all propaganda its not like theyre just <b><u>point</u></b>ing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the obvious <b><u>ones</u></b> student interest in the subject influences <b><u>professor</u></b> ratings really juan trucupey youre the one who is claiming that it is <b><u>sexist</u></b> against males to imply that <b><u>gender</u></b> affects ratings before listing a students interest in the subject matter i never said that so your complaint that im contradicting myself is wrong isee more propaganda lol i literally have had female students look for profs who are called a <b><u>bit</u></b>ch it apparently means something different to people good to know those students just graduating with phds now one went to georgetown another is a teacher matthew lucky 34 aint <b><u>bad</u></b> "

explaining my comment for me yes because being male or white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges the way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face bias jacq jones not at all i think it is the opposite those who think that any disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination are just burying their heads in sand because they dont like the implications ransell dsouza he was trying to write of course in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as of cause notice he also replaced the word hire with high its probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof innokenty kantor unless you are already hiring inferior candidates who happen to fit your bias eg white men in which case expanded the range of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires whats of cause innokenty kantor yes its nice apologies for not getting reference id love to see this extended to include racial bias because sadly i think this would be even more pronounced and the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at best innokenty kantor there seems to be a strong correlation that white men dont believe academia is sexist and racist backed up by <b><u>several</u></b> studies seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their existing culture which is really just code for biases towards wht they think ideal

       "i remember my first student evaluations 1 more short skirts 2 your hair looks so much better down 3 the psych building is too far away from my dorm room i decided at this point that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my teaching see more kristy m keefe my first <b><u>semester</u></b> teaching i got two comments saying to wear less clothes as a new <b><u>instructor</u></b> this was not what i was expecting and not helpful in how i could improve as an educator sadly this may have been the first time i received comments about my appearance but it was not the last ugh thats sexual harassment i got one saying someone should make a <b><u>calendar</u></b> with pictures of my sexy butt literally kristy m keefe i had the opposite for the hair my hair is long and i always wear it down student said that i either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is unprofessional students will reach for anything when they want to be negative one time a student asked me a question about the midterm and i said i hadnt finished it yet they mentioned that in my rmp rating lol like they never procrastinate amanda carroll were you tempted to <b><u>clap</u></b> back with do you mean fewer these sites are just nonsense appalling levels of sexual harassment and not just against women ive known male teachers have similarly <b><u>inappropriate</u></b> comments posted kristy m keefe for sure amanda greubel nope i have also had some wonderfully thoughtful comments about my courses ill take the bad with the good angry people en route joshua shinn how dare youim not angry i just hate to disappoint anyone being a good prof doesnt hurt either michael w hitch i had this one professor back in my college days that was without a doubt the best professor i ever had his rmp ratings were trashed because he wasnt an easy a a lot of us couldnt believe it because we loved him and he asked if wsee more michael w hitch dude it doesnt matter for some of us christ being a good professor has nothing to do with good evaluations and i would go so far to say that the effective professor does not get good reviews do be glib though woosh my teaching reviews like my article reviews fell neatly into thirds one third fantastic no improvement needed one third ok but one third who let this idiot leave his village i suffered a bit because my undergrad subject was a demanding see more the person paying for the service should be the one to decide how that service should be evaluatedif they want to judge it on financial <b><u>merit</u></b> or educational <b><u>merit</u></b> or social <b><u>merit</u></b> its up to them see more stephen cooper setting aside the sneer in your comment my point was of course that the principle of having ones teaching evaluated is fine but the execution ends up failing its purpose i doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the studsee more my favorite criticism from a student on rmp every other professor wants you to succeed she only cares about how much you learn the rest of the review made clear that success was just about a specific letter gradestudent evals usually tell us more about students than about teachers my favorite criticism on a student eval she doesnt teach us the content she expects us to learn it ourselves apparently the fact that i dont lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isnt good teaching _ no kiddinyou mean a <b><u>popularity</u></b> contest turns out to be like a <b><u>popularity</u></b> contest ill be damned youre not wrong tenure attractive any day promote these large nostrils and heavy baggaged eyes please i wont lie the chili

we are getting somewhere while we are literally filling concentration camps seems an incredibly odd time to pass any sort of <b><u><b><u>gun</u></b> control legislation</u></b> whats the functionality

ammunition at <b><u>licensed target ranges</u></b> and youre not allowed to take the ammunition home any weapon not capable of selective fire is ipso facto not an assault rifle lacking one of the defining features of the category dont forget the pistol grip makes it a lot more deadly if you live in ny bayonets are pretty cool though i like spears spears are <b><u>good</u></b> i did not know this before i saw thisthanks for the education naw i dont agree with this <b><u>large capacity magazine bans</u></b> definitely save lives expect awb 20 to just ban <b><u>semi<b><u>automatic</u></b> rifle</u></b>sand expect the next evolution of the ar pattern to allow you to cock it with your thumb or something like that this is what a <b><u>legal ar15</u></b> looks like with an <b><u><b><u>assault <b><u>weapons</u></b></u></b> ban</u></b> still shoots the same just less comfortable to hold no <b><u>such thing full auto semiauto</u></b> or <b><u>single fire</u></b> the suppressor ban has somehow kept mass shooters loud though here you go kevin gilbert these are the types i associate with you forget the 3 round burst to fully auto they wanna ban both and confiscate all that are already out there <b><u>eric knabe austin</u></b> rose ill take my 12ga with a 35 in buck over these toys any day this all assumes theyd call an assault rifle the <b><u>same thing</u></b> as the old banthat said i really dont see any <b><u>particular weapon ban</u></b> working when almost any other kind of firearm would be just as effectivesee more thats not true you can limit it to just <b><u>single action <b><u>rifles</u></b></u></b> and not 30 <b><u>round clips combat</u></b> <b><u>rifles</u></b> like ars arent the same as simple hunting <b><u>rifles</u></b> roberto acquafredda also pick up your shit while you still can extended <b><u>mag bans</u></b> almost always come first when did all these <b><u><b><u>gun</u></b> grabbers</u></b> start following this page if its such an issue to you then move to freaking canada where owning a firearm is not a constitutional rightdont try to abolish that right here just because you think its <b><u>acceptable fosee more</u></b> fixed this for you so my rifle will be <b><u>worth more money thanks</u></b> dumbocrats the majority of the <b><u>population supports</u></b> banning them left <b><u>slanted polling shows</u></b> about 75 the <b><u>recent polling</u></b> from fox news obviously right slanted shows 66 in favor of a <b><u>new permanent awb</u></b> i sort of assume but does anyone know if the 3 who own half of all <b><u>gun</u></b>s 8 or more each person are mostly or all white supremacists forgets selective fire is the main definition of an assault rifle 2019 <b><u><b><u>assault <b><u>weapons</u></b></u></b> ban</u></b> billhttps <b><u>chris brian swientek</u></b> confirm its an assault weapon built for 1 thing only kill lots of people very quickly the <b><u>only difference</u></b> between the civilian and <b><u>military m16</u></b> is the switch to <b><u>full <b><u>automatic</u></b></u></b> its like letting anyone drive a semi truck or passenger bus without training dead schoolchildren the price we pay so some smalldicked boy can prance around playing <b><u>scary army man enlist u pussy</u></b> oh yea that shoot back pussys the awb did little but drive innovation in the <b><u>firearms market</u></b> heres an example the olympic oa96https so just out of curiosity what exactly does a threaded barrel do new to this page and am genuinely <b><u>curious

<b><u>more</u></b> <b><u>kristy m keefe</u></b> my <b><u>first semester teaching</u></b> i got two comments saying to wear less clothes as a <b><u>new instructor</u></b> this was not what i was expecting and not helpful in how i could improve as an educator sadly this may have been the first time i received comments about my appearance but it was not the last ugh thats <b><u>sexual harassment</u></b> i got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt literally <b><u>kristy m keefe</u></b> i had the opposite for the hair my hair is long and i always wear it down <b><u>student</u></b> said that i either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is <b><u>unprofessional <b><u>student</u></b>s</u></b> will reach for anything when they want to be negative one time a <b><u>student</u></b> asked me a question about the midterm and i said i hadnt finished it yet they mentioned that in my <b><u>rmp rating lol</u></b> like they never procrastinate <b><u>amanda carroll</u></b> were you tempted to clap back with do you mean fewer these sites are just <b><u>nonsense appalling levels</u></b> of <b><u>sexual harassment</u></b> and not just against women ive known <b><u>male teachers</u></b> have similarly <b><u>inappropriate comments</u></b> posted <b><u>kristy m keefe</u></b> for <b><u>sure amanda greubel</u></b> nope i have also had some wonderfully <b><u>thoughtful comments</u></b> about my courses ill take the bad with the <b><u><b><u>good</u></b> angry <b><u>people</u></b></u></b> en <b><u>route joshua

<b><u>professor</u></b> back in my college days that was without a doubt the <b><u>best <b><u>professor</u></b></u></b> i ever had his rmp ratings were trashed because he wasnt an easy a a lot of us couldnt believe it because we loved him and he asked if wsee <b><u>more</u></b> <b><u><b><u>michael w hitch</u></b> dude</u></b> it doesnt matter for some of us christ being a <b><u><b><u><b><u>good</u></b> prof</u></b>essor</u></b> has nothing to do with <b><u><b><u>good</u></b> evaluations</u></b> and i would go so far to say that the <b><u>effective

<b><u>review</u></b>s</u></b> fell neatly into thirds one third fantastic no improvement needed one third ok but one third who let this idiot leave his village i suffered a bit because my

<b><u>financial merit</u></b> or <b><u>educational merit</u></b> or <b><u>social merit</u></b> its up to them see <b><u><b><u>more</u></b> stephen cooper</u></b> setting aside the sneer in your comment my point was of course that the principle of having ones teaching evaluated is fine but the execution ends up failing its purpose i doubt that <b><u>such evaluations</u></b> are even a <b><u><b><u>good</u></b> test</u></b> of the studsee <b><u>more</u></b> my favorite criticism from a <b><u>student</u></b> on rmp every <b><u>other <b><u>professor</u></b></u></b> wants you to succeed she only cares about how much you learn the rest of the <b><u>review</u></b> made clear that success was just about a specific letter grade<b><u><b><u>student</u></b> eval</u></b>s usually tell us <b><u>more</u></b> about <b><u>student</u></b>s than about teachers my favorite criticism on a <b><u><b><u>student</u></b> eval</u></b> she doesnt teach us the content she expects us to learn it ourselves apparently the fact that i dont lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isnt <b><u><b><u>good</u></b> teaching _</u></b> no kiddinyou mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest ill be damned youre not wrong tenure attractive any day promote these large nostrils and <b><u>heavy baggaged eyes</u></b> please i wont lie the chili peppers are from my nephews should i remind that correlation does not mean causation innokenty kantor you seem to assume that universities hire <b><u>more</u></b> poorly qualified non<b><u>white</u></b> nonmales over <b><u>better qualified <b><u>white</u></b> males</u></b> whereas in reality the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against <b><u>people</u></b> who are <b><u>more</u></b>see <b><u>more</u></b> <b><u>innokenty kantor thanks</u></b> for explaining my comment for me yes because being male or <b><u>white</u></b> has never been shown to be the <b><u>direct cause</u></b> of very tangible privileges the way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face <b><u>bias jacq jones</u></b> not at all i think it is the opposite those who think that any disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination are just burying their heads in sand because they dont like the implications ransell dsouza he was trying to write of course in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as of <b><u>cause notice</u></b> he also replaced the word hire with high its probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof innokenty kantor unless you are already hiring <b><u>inferior candidates</u></b> who happen to fit your <b><u>bias eg <b><u><b><u>white</u></b> men</u></b></u></b> in which case expanded the range of <b><u>people</u></b> you consider will enhance the quality of your hires whats of cause innokenty kantor yes its nice apologies for not getting reference id love to see this extended to include <b><u>racial bias</u></b> because sadly i think this would be even <b><u>more</u></b> pronounced and the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at <b><u>best innokenty kantor</u></b> there seems to be a strong correlation that <b><u><b><u>white</u></b> men</u></b> dont believe academia is sexist and racist backed up by <b><u>several studies</u></b> seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the <b><u>best candidate</u></b> rather than the one that most closely matches their existing culture which is really just code for biases towards wht they think <b><u>ideal candidates</u></b> are like and the <b><u>dsee <b><u>more</u></b> issues</u></b> with the methodology but not news i dont even look any<b><u>more</u></b> you must not be an adjunct i dont want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs i apply to every year well i get three out of four thats how i do it wait there are adults who actually care about whats written on ratemy<b><u>professor</u></b> no of you should ever under any circumstances read rate my <b><u>professor</u></b> no <b><u>good</u></b> comes of it and i firmly believe there should be a rate my <b><u><b><u>student</u></b> site</u></b> mirrors typical life i dont bother with the <b><u>actual university evaluations</u></b> let alone this garbage ditto especially after reading a rape fantasy i hope you reported that bob borrelli why so they can all laugh about it pick up <b><u>lines graphic sexual fantasies sexual assault</u></b> and notes like pretty sure i found your house were totally ignored tashana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you you brought it to our attention years ago <b><u>white</u></b> yes male no <b><u>tenured hahaha attractive</u></b> um <b><u>brenna e culbert</u></b> my <b><u>favorite comment</u></b> on

<b><u>evidence hadil ghoneim</u></b> here you go im attractive though <b><u>white</u></b> yes male yes tenured no attractive not really my rmp ratings still suck although i have a <b><u>few <b><u>good</u></b> ones</u></b> jess moore the most <b><u>frequent descriptor <b><u>people</u></b></u></b> use for me is boring that one cuts me to my soul im <b><u>fun brian paul</u></b> i agree and my ratings are largely <b><u>good</u></b> and even the <b><u>negative ones</u></b> are <b><u>worthwhile brian paul</u></b> i just got a <b><u>bad <b><u>review</u></b></u></b> for giving too much work for a minimester class im not even sure how to take that am i supposed to assign <b><u>less work</u></b> during a minimester i was told youre supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now i wonder about that aurora le well <b><u>shit ami sedani new study</u></b> <b><u>more</u></b> like duh <b><u>lol lisa parker lebovitz daniel malcom thanks</u></b> ive got to get back to the data i think we can refute this maybe the <b><u>young <b><u>white</u></b> male faculty</u></b> arent as attractive to <b><u>student</u></b>s in pharmacy as in <b><u>humanities francesca bosisio</u></b> my favourite bit of feedback received from a <b><u>student</u></b> who scored my course a 0please can there be better references not of those written ages ago when they used <b><u>sophisticated words</u></b>cause who comes to university to learn <b><u>sophisticated words</u></b> lets <b><u>usee <b><u>more</u></b> harry green brilliant bob borrelli</u></b> yeah fuck that guy and his <b><u>sophisticated words</u></b> d who literally invented meteorology hey can you link the math paper using emoji that would be awesome and id like to read itthis is a <b><u>good</u></b> one about emoji but its not written in it though it has some examples of retelling https well i am an <b><u>unattractive <b><u>white</u></b> female</u></b> and get <b><u>great <b><u>review</u></b>s</u></b> and teach a subject that is considered hard perhaps it would be profitable to spend some time studying statistics you fulfill one of the categories then <b><u>good</u></b>foryou i see you dont understand how studies work a study never reports that in 100 of cases this happens and in 0 of cases this happened if that were true providing one <b><u>contrary story</u></b> would be enough to destroy the findings of the studystudies look at the way things tend to be maybe <b><u>people</u></b> who fulfill certain criteria are <b><u>more</u></b> likely to get <b><u>positive <b><u>review</u></b>s</u></b> but its not a guarantee one way or the other still funny race and gender are less important than <b><u>attractiveness <b><u>student</u></b> interest</u></b> and discipline but the first two features in the headline is <b><u>white</u></b> and male stop contradicting the facts with your <b><u>divisive ideology <b><u>juan trucupey</u></b> cool story bro catherine glass</u></b> its easy to laugh when youre the <b><u>beneficiary <b><u>juan trucupey</u></b></u></b> thats not contradicting facts its emphasising some things that the study found <b><u>more</u></b> than others but i bet the standard of attractiveness and gender interact as well juan yes its all propaganda its not like theyre just pointing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the <b><u>obvious ones <b><u>student</u></b> interest</u></b> in the subject influences <b><u><b><u>professor</u></b> ratings</u></b> really <b><u>juan trucupey</u></b> youre the one who is claiming that it is sexist against males to imply that gender affects ratings before listing a <b><u><b><u>student</u></b>s interest</u></b> in the <b><u>subject matter</u></b> i never said that so your complaint that im contradicting myself is <b><u>wrong isee <b><u>more</u></b> propaganda</u></b> lol i literally have had <b><u>female <b><u>student</u></b>s</u></b> look for profs who are called a bitch it apparently means something different to <b><u><b><u>people</u></b> <b><u>good</u></b></u></b> to know those <b><u>student</u></b>s just graduating with phds now one went to georgetown another is a <b><u>teacher matthew lucky</u></b> 34 aint bad "

       "one slight problem there is a <b><u>difference</u></b> between <b><u>assault rifles</u></b> and <b><u>assault weapons</u></b> an assault rifle is a <b><u>select fire shoulder weapon</u></b> chambered in an <b><u>intermediate cartridge</u></b> and was already regulated by the nfa as a <b><u>machine gun</u></b> before they were even invented an assault weapon is whatever the fuck liberals in <b><u>new york</u></b> and california want to call it in order to make <b><u>sure citizens</u></b> cant have good guns putting your focus on arguing <b><u>semantics</u></b> vs broadly accepted no<b><u>men</u></b>clature is not going to help anything <b><u>randall munro</u></b> broadly accepted doesnt mean its correct <b><u>randall munro</u></b> except thats not <b><u>semantics</u></b> thats <b><u>literal legal definition</u></b> of an <b><u>assualt rifle</u></b> and assualt weapon can literally be anything someone deems scarey theres no legal definition for it at all being incorrect on <b><u>legal technicalities</u></b> doesnt help our image much either dont act like no reactionary will ever see it pick it apart and tell everyone we dont know what were doing an assault rifle has an

you know what the only distance between a <b><u>semiautomatic rifle</u></b> and a <b><u>pistol</u></b> is <b><u>effective range</u></b> and rifles require two hands to shoot and cant be concealed thats it both are equally <b><u>deadly</u></b> just because you are afraid of the <b><u>word semiautomatic</u></b> doesnt mean its an assault weapon <b><u>pistol</u></b>s are semiautomatic too are you

<b><u>right</u></b> now this is an idiotic take the solution isnt to ban the weapons but the <b><u>calibres</u></b> the 556x45mm bullet is a military cartridge that has no function in either

decades and collectorsreenactors can still get a bar or something if they want but nobodys been getting killed with them dont ban the gun then ban the <b><u>ammunition</u></b> make it so you can only buy <b><u>ammunition</u></b> at licensed target ranges and youre not allowed to take the <b><u>ammunition</u></b> home any weapon not capable of selective fire is ipso facto not an assault rifle lacking one of the defining features of the cat<b><u>ego</u></b>ry dont forget the <b><u>pistol</u></b> grip makes it a <b><u>lot</u></b> more <b><u>deadly</u></b> if you live in ny bayonets are pretty cool though i like spears spears are good i did not know this before i saw thisthanks for the education naw i dont agree with this <b><u>large</u></b> capacity magazine bans definitely save lives expect <b><u>awb</u></b> 20 to just ban <b><u>semiautomatic rifle</u></b>sand expect the next evolution of the <b><u>ar pattern</u></b> to allow you to cock it with your thumb or something like that this is what a legal <b><u>ar15</u></b> looks like with an <b><u>assault weapons</u></b> ban still shoots the same just less comfortable to hold no such thing <b><u>full</u></b> auto semiauto or single fire the <b><u><b><u>suppress</u></b>or ban</u></b> has somehow kept mass shooters loud though here you go kevin gilbert these are the <b><u>type</u></b>s i associate with you forget the 3 round burst to <b><u>full</u></b>y auto they wanna ban both and confiscate all that are already out there eric knabe austin rose ill take my 12ga with a 35 in buck over these toys any day this all assumes theyd call an assault rifle the same thing as the old banthat said i really dont see any particular weapon ban working when almost any other kind of firearm would be just as effectivesee more thats not true you can limit it to just single action rifles and not 30 round clips combat rifles like ars arent the same as simple <b><u>hunting</u></b> rifles roberto acquafredda also pick up your shit while you still can extended mag bans almost always come first when did all these gun grabbers start following this <b><u>page</u></b> if its such an issue to you then move to freaking canada where owning a firearm is not a constitutional <b><u>right</u></b>dont try to abolish that <b><u>right</u></b> here just because you think its acceptable fosee more fixed this for you so my rifle will be worth more money thanks dumbocrats the majority of the population <b><u>support</u></b>s banning them left slanted polling shows about 75 the recent polling from fox news obviously <b><u>right</u></b> slanted shows 66 in favor of a new permanent <b><u>awb</u></b> i sort of assume but does anyone know if the 3 who own half of all guns 8 or more each person are mostly or all white supremacists forgets selective fire is the main definition of an assault rifle 2019 <b><u>assault weapons</u></b> ban billhttps chris brian swientek confirm its an assault weapon built for 1 thing only kill <b><u>lot</u></b>s of <b><u>people</u></b> very quickly the only <b><u>difference</u></b> between the civilian and military <b><u>m16</u></b> is the switch to <b><u>full</u></b> automatic its like letting anyone drive a semi truck or passenger bus without training dead schoolchildren the price we pay so some smalldicked boy can prance around playing scary army man enlist u pussy oh yea that shoot back pussys the <b><u>awb</u></b> did little but drive innovation in the firearms market heres an example the olympic oa96https so just out of curiosity what exactly does a <b><u>threaded</u></b> <b><u>barrel</u></b> do new to this <b><u>page</u></b> and am genuinely curious ben<b><u>machine gun</u></b> assault rifle weapons liberalised false story"

       "i remember my <b><u>first student evaluations</u></b> 1 more short skirts 2 your <b><u>hair</u></b> looks so <b><u>much</u></b> <b><u>better</u></b> down 3 the psych building is too far a<b><u>way</u></b> from my dorm room i decided at this <b><u>point</u></b> that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my <b><u>teaching</u></b> see more kristy m keefe my <b><u>first semester <b><u>teaching</u></b></u></b> i got two <b><u>comments</u></b> saying to wear less c<b><u>lot</u></b>hes as a new instructor this was not what i was expecting and not helpful in how i could improve as an <b><u>educator</u></b> sadly this may have been the first <b><u>time</u></b> i received <b><u>comments</u></b> about my appearance but it was not the last ugh thats <b><u>sexual harassment</u></b> i got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt literally kristy m keefe i had the <b><u>opposite</u></b> for the <b><u>hair</u></b> my <b><u>hair</u></b> is long and i al<b><u>way</u></b>s wear it down student said that i either needed to cut my <b><u>hair</u></b> or wear it in a bun because long <b><u>hair</u></b> is unprofessional students will reach for anything when they want to be <b><u>negative</u></b> one <b><u>time</u></b> a student asked me a question about the midterm and i said i hadnt finished it yet they mentioned that in my <b><u>rmp rating lol</u></b> like they never procrastinate amanda carroll were you tempted to clap back with do you mean fewer these <b><u>sites</u></b> are just nonsense appalling levels of <b><u>sexual harassment</u></b> and not just against women ive known <b><u>male <b><u>teachers</u></b></u></b> have similarly inappropriate <b><u>comments</u></b> posted kristy m keefe for <b><u>sure amanda greubel</u></b> nope i have also had some wonderfully thoughtful <b><u>comments</u></b> about my <b><u>courses</u></b> ill take the <b><u>bad</u></b> with the <b><u>good angry people</u></b> en <b><u>route joshua shinn</u></b> how dare youim not angry i just hate to disap<b><u>point</u></b> anyone being a <b><u>good prof</u></b> doesnt hurt either michael w hitch i had this one <b><u>professor</u></b> back in my <b><u>college days</u></b> that was without a doubt the best <b><u>professor</u></b> i ever had his rmp ratings were trashed because he wasnt an <b><u>easy</u></b> a a <b><u>lot</u></b> of us couldnt believe it because we loved him and he asked if wsee more michael w hitch dude it doesnt matter for some of us christ being a good <b><u>professor</u></b> has nothing to do with <b><u>good evaluations</u></b> and i would go so far to say that the effective <b><u>professor</u></b> does not get <b><u>good reviews</u></b> do be glib though woosh my <b><u>teaching</u></b> reviews like my article reviews fell neatly into <b><u>thirds</u></b> one third fantastic no <b><u>improvement</u></b> needed one third ok but one third who let this idiot leave his village i suffered a <b><u>bit</u></b> because my <b><u>undergrad subject</u></b> was a demanding see more the person paying for the <b><u>service</u></b> should be the one to decide how that <b><u>service</u></b> should be evaluatedif they want to judge it on <b><u>financial merit</u></b> or educational merit or social merit its up to them see more stephen cooper setting aside the sneer in your comment my <b><u>point</u></b> was of course that the <b><u>principle</u></b> of having <b><u>ones</u></b> <b><u>teaching</u></b> evaluated is fine but the execution ends up failing its purpose i doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the studsee more my <b><u>favorite criticism</u></b> from a student on rmp every other <b><u>professor</u></b> wants you to succeed she only cares about how <b><u>much</u></b> you learn the rest of the review made <b><u>clear</u></b> that <b><u>success</u></b> was just about a specific letter gradestudent evals usually tell us more about students than about <b><u>teachers</u></b> my <b><u>favorite criticism</u></b> on a student eval she doesnt teach us the content she expects us to learn it ourselves apparently the <b><u>fact</u></b> that i dont lecture from the text and expect them to come to <b><u>class</u></b> having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isnt good <b><u>teaching</u></b> _ no kiddinyou mean a <b><u>popularity contest</u></b> turns out to be like a <b><u>popularity contest</u></b> ill be damned youre not <b><u>wrong tenure</u></b> attractive any day promote these <b><u>large nostrils</u></b> and heavy baggaged eyes please i wont lie the chili peppers are from my nephews should i remind that <b><u>correlation</u></b> does not mean <b><u>causation</u></b> innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> you seem to assume that <b><u>universities</u></b> hire more poorly qualified non<b><u>white</u></b> nonmales over <b><u>better</u></b> qualified <b><u>white</u></b> males whereas in <b><u>reality</u></b> the whole <b><u>point</u></b> of <b><u>diversity practices</u></b> in <b><u>hiring</u></b> is to mitigate <b><u>bias</u></b> against people who are <b><u>moresee</u></b> more innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> thanks for explaining my comment for me yes because being male or <b><u>white</u></b> has never been shown to be the <b><u>direct cause</u></b> of very <b><u>tangible privileges</u></b> the <b><u>way</u></b> some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face <b><u>bias</u></b> jacq j<b><u>ones</u></b> not at all i think it is the <b><u>opposite</u></b> those who think that any disproportion is a <b><u>result</u></b> of <b><u>bias</u></b> or <b><u>discrimination</u></b> are just burying their <b><u>heads</u></b> in sand because they dont like the implications ransell dsouza he was trying to write of course in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as of cause notice he also replaced the <b><u>word</u></b> hire with high its probably a <b><u>combination</u></b> of using <b><u>autocorrect</u></b> and a <b><u>complete lack</u></b> of <b><u>proof</u></b> innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> unless you are already <b><u>hiring</u></b> <b><u>inferior candidates</u></b> who happen to fit your <b><u>bias</u></b> eg <b><u>white</u></b> men in which <b><u>case</u></b> expanded the <b><u>range</u></b> of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires whats of cause innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> yes its <b><u>nice apologies</u></b> for not getting reference id love to see this extended to include racial <b><u>bias</u></b> because sadly i think this would be even more pronounced and the weighting often put on these for tenure is <b><u>problematic</u></b> at best innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b> there seems to be a strong <b><u>correlation</u></b> that <b><u>white</u></b> men dont believe <b><u>academia</u></b> is <b><u>sexist</u></b> and <b><u>racist</u></b> backed up by <b><u>several studies</u></b> seems to <b><u>point</u></b> to a causality of their <b><u>fear</u></b> of losing <b><u>status</u></b> in a field <b><u>bias</u></b>ed towards them the most <b><u>laughable part</u></b> is the <b><u>assumption</u></b> that <b><u>universities</u></b> hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their existing culture which is really just code for <b><u>bias</u></b>es towards wht they think ideal candidates are like and the dsee more issues with the methodology but not news i dont even look anymore you must not be an adjunct i dont want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs i apply to every <b><u>year</u></b> well i get three out of four thats how i do it wait there are adults who actually care about whats written on <b><u>rate</u></b>my<b><u>professor</u></b> no of you should ever under any circumstances read <b><u>rate</u></b> my <b><u>professor</u></b> no good comes of it and i firmly believe there should be a <b><u>rate</u></b> my student site mirrors typical life i dont bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage ditto especially after reading a rape fantasy i hope you reported that bob borrelli why so they can all laugh about it pick up lines graphic sexual fantasies sexual assault and notes like pretty sure i found your house were totally ignored tashana this <b><u>kind</u></b> of stuff al<b><u>way</u></b>s makes me think of you you brought it to our attention <b><u>year</u></b>s ago <b><u>white</u></b> yes male no <b><u>tenured hahaha attractive</u></b> um brenna e culbert my favorite comment on rmp was she has a <b><u>lot</u></b> of patience even with the stupid question people amanda evert they repeated your study sarina kilham thanks adding it to my stockpile of evidence hadil ghoneim here you go im attractive though <b><u>white</u></b> yes male yes tenured no attractive not really my rmp ratings still suck although i have a few good <b><u>ones</u></b> jess moore the most frequent descriptor people use for me is boring that one cuts me to my soul im <b><u>fun brian paul</u></b> i agree and my ratings are largely good and even the <b><u>negative</u></b> <b><u>ones</u></b> are worthwhile brian paul i just got a <b><u>bad</u></b> review for giving too <b><u>much</u></b> work for a minimester <b><u>class</u></b> im not even sure how to take that am i supposed to assign less work during a minimester i was told youre supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now i wonder about that aurora le well shit ami sedani new study more like duh lol lisa parker lebovitz daniel malcom thanks ive got to get back to the data i think we can refute this maybe the young <b><u>white</u></b> male faculty arent as attractive to students in <b><u>pharmacy</u></b> as in <b><u>humanities francesca bosisio</u></b> my favourite <b><u>bit</u></b> of <b><u>feedback</u></b> received from a student who scored my course a 0please can there be <b><u>better</u></b> references not of those written ages ago when they used sophisticated <b><u>word</u></b>scause who comes to university to learn sophisticated <b><u>word</u></b>s lets usee more harry green brilliant bob borrelli yeah fuck that guy and his sophisticated <b><u>word</u></b>s d who literally invented meteorology hey can you link the math paper using <b><u>emoji</u></b> that would be awesome and id like to read itthis is a good one about <b><u>emoji</u></b> but its not written in it though it has some examples of retelling https well i am an unattractive <b><u>white</u></b> female and get great reviews and teach a subject that is considered hard perhaps it would be profitable to spend some <b><u>time</u></b> studying statistics you fulfill one of the categories then goodforyou i see you dont understand how studies work a study never reports that in 100 of <b><u>case</u></b>s this happens and in 0 of <b><u>case</u></b>s this happened if that were true providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the studystudies look at the <b><u>way</u></b> things tend to be maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but its not a <b><u>guarantee</u></b> one <b><u>way</u></b> or the other still <b><u>funny race</u></b> and <b><u>gender</u></b> are less <b><u>important</u></b> than attractiveness student interest and <b><u>discipline</u></b> but the first two <b><u>features</u></b> in the <b><u>headline</u></b> is <b><u>white</u></b> and male stop contradicting the <b><u>fact</u></b>s with your divisive ideology juan trucupey cool story bro catherine glass its <b><u>easy</u></b> to laugh when youre the <b><u>beneficiary juan trucupey</u></b> thats not contradicting <b><u>fact</u></b>s its emphasising some things that the study found more than others but i bet the standard of attractiveness and <b><u>gender</u></b> interact as well juan yes its all propaganda its not like theyre just <b><u>point</u></b>ing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the obvious <b><u>ones</u></b> student interest in the subject influences <b><u>professor</u></b> ratings really juan trucupey youre the one who is claiming that it is <b><u>sexist</u></b> against males to imply that <b><u>gender</u></b> affects ratings before listing a students interest in the subject matter i never said that so your complaint that im contradicting myself is wrong isee more propaganda lol i literally have had female students look for profs who are called a <b><u>bit</u></b>ch it apparently means something different to people good to know those students just graduating with phds now one went to georgetown another is a teacher matthew lucky 34 aint <b><u>bad</u></b> "

       "one <b><u>slight problem</u></b>. there is a <b><u>difference</u></b> between <b><u>assault <b><u>rifles</u></b></u></b> and <b><u>assault <b><u>weapon</u></b>s</u></b>. an assault rifle is a <b><u>select <b><u>fire</u></b></u></b> shoulder <b><u>weapon</u></b> chambered in an <b><u>intermediate cartridge</u></b> and was already regulated by the nfa as a <b><u>machine <b><u>gun</u></b></u></b> before they were even invented. an assault <b><u>weapon</u></b> is whatever the <b><u>fuck liberals</u></b> in <b><u>new york</u></b> and california want to call it in order to make <b><u>sure citizens</u></b> can't have <b><u>good <b><u>gun</u></b>s</u></b>.. putting your focus on arguing semantics vs broadly accepted nomenclature is not going to help any<b><u>thing</u></b>,. <b><u>randall munro</u></b> broadly accepted doesn’t mean it’s correct.. <b><u>randall munro</u></b> except that's not semantics. that's <b><u>literal <b><u>legal definition</u></b></u></b> of an <b><u>assualt rifle</u></b>. and assualt <b><u>weapon</u></b> can literally be any<b><u>thing</u></b> someone deems scarey. theres no <b><u>legal definition</u></b> for it at all. being incorrect on <b><u>legal technicalities</u></b> doesn't help our image much either. don't act like no re<b><u>action</u></b>ary will ever see it, pick it apart, and tell everyone we don't know what we're doing. an assault rifle has an <b><u><b><u>auto</u></b>matic selector switch</u></b>. it is already <b><u>ban</u></b>ned. that an overlooked technicality here . marie

white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges. the way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face <b><u>bias</u></b>.. jacq j<b><u>one</u></b>s not at all. i think it is the <b><u>opposite</u></b>: those who think that any disproportion is a result of <b><u>bias</u></b> or discrimination, are just burying their heads in sand. because they don't like the implications.. ransell d'souza he was trying to write 'of course' in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as 'of cause.' notice he also replaced the word hire with 'high.' it's probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof. <b><u>innokenty <b><u>kantor</u></b></u></b> unless you are already hiring <b><u>inferior candidates</u></b> who happen to fit

profitable to spend some <b><u>time</u></b> <b><u>study</u></b>ing statistics.. you fulfill <b><u>one</u></b> of the categories, then.. goodforyou. i see you don't understand how studies work. a <b><u>study</u></b> never reports that in 100% of cases this happens, and in 0% of cases, this happened. if that were true, providing <b><u>one</u></b> contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the <b><u>study</u></b>.studies look at the <b><u>way things</u></b> tend to be. maybe <b><u>people</u></b> who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get <b><u>positive <b><u>review</u></b>s</u></b> but it's not a guarantee <b><u>one</u></b> way or the other still.. funny: race and gender are  less important than <b><u>attractiveness</u></b>, <b><u><b><u>student</u></b> <b><u>interest</u></b></u></b> and discipline, but the first two features in the headline is “white” and “male”. stop contradicting the facts with your divisive ideology!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. <b><u>juan trucupey</u></b> cool story bro. catherine glass it’s easy to laugh when you’re the beneficiary. <b><u>juan trucupey</u></b> that’s not contradicting facts. it’s emphasising some things that the <b><u>study</u></b> found more than others. but i bet the standard of <b><u>attractiveness</u></b> and gender interact as well. juan yes it's all propaganda; it's not like they're just <b><u>point</u></b>ing out the most <b><u><b><u>interest</u></b>ing conclusions</u></b> of the <b><u>study</u></b> rather than the <b><u>obvious <b><u>one</u></b>s</u></b>.

       "one <b><u>slight problem</u></b>. there is a <b><u>difference</u></b> between <b><u>assault <b><u>rifles</u></b></u></b> and <b><u>assault <b><u>weapon</u></b>s</u></b>. an assault rifle is a <b><u><b><u>select <b><u>fire</u></b></u></b> shoulder <b><u>weapon</u></b></u></b> chambered in an <b><u>intermediate cartridge</u></b> and was already regulated by the <b><u>nfa</u></b> as a <b><u>machine gun</u></b> before they were even invented. an assault <b><u>weapon</u></b> is whatever the <b><u>fuck liberals</u></b> in <b><u><b><u>new</u></b> york</u></b> and <b><u>california</u></b> want to call it in <b><u>order</u></b> to make <b><u>sure citizens</u></b> can't have <b><u>good guns</u></b>.. putting your <b><u>focus</u></b> on arguing <b><u>semantics</u></b> vs broadly accepted <b><u>nomenclature</u></b> is not going to help anything,. <b><u>randall munro</u></b> broadly accepted doesn’t mean it’s <b><u>correct</u></b>.. <b><u>randall munro</u></b> except that's not <b><u>semantics</u></b>. that's <b><u>literal legal definition</u></b> of an <b><u>assualt rifle</u></b>. and assualt <b><u>weapon</u></b> can literally be anything someone deems scarey. theres no legal definition for it at all. being <b><u>in<b><u>correct</u></b></u></b> on <b><u>legal technicalities</u></b> doesn't help our image much either. don't act like no reactionary will ever see it, pick it apart, and tell everyone we don't know what we're doing. an assault rifle has an <b><u>automatic selector switch</u></b>. it is already

some<b><u>one</u></b> should make a <b><u>calendar</u></b> with <b><u>pictures</u></b> of my sexy butt, literally. kristy m keefe i had the <b><u>opposite</u></b> for the <b><u>hair</u></b>. my

<b><u>long</u></b> <b><u>hair</u></b> is <b><u>unprofessional</u></b>.. <b><u>student</u></b>s will reach for anything when they want to be <b><u>negative</u></b>. <b><u>one</u></b> <b><u>time</u></b> a <b><u>student</u></b> asked me a <b><u>question</u></b> about the midterm, and i said i hadn't finished it yet. they menti<b><u>one</u></b>d that in my <b><u><b><u>rmp</u></b> rating</u></b>, lol.

<b><u>professor</u></b> has nothing to do with <b><u>good</u></b> evaluations, and i would go so far to say that the effective <b><u>professor</u></b> does not get <b><u>good</u></b> reviews. do be glib though.. . woosh. my <b><u>teaching</u></b> reviews, like my <b><u>article reviews</u></b>, fell neatly into <b><u>thirds</u></b>: <b><u>one</u></b> third - <b><u>fantastic</u></b>, no improvement needed; <b><u>one</u></b> third - ok but...; <b><u>one</u></b> third - who let this idiot leave his village? i suffered a <b><u>bit</u></b> be<b><u>cause</u></b> my <b><u>undergrad

<b><u>rmp</u></b>: “every other <b><u>professor</u></b> wants you to succeed. she only cares about how <b><u>much</u></b> you learn.” the rest of the review made clear that “success” was just about a specific letter grade.<b><u>student</u></b> evals usually tell us more about <b><u>student</u></b>s than about <b><u>teachers</u></b>.. my <b><u>favorite criticism</u></b> on a <b><u>student</u></b> eval: “she doesn’t teach us the content, she expects us to learn it ourselves.” apparently the <b><u>fact</u></b> that i don’t lecture from the text and expect them to come to <b><u>class</u></b> having d<b><u>one</u></b> the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isn’t “<b><u>good</u></b> <b><u>teaching</u></b>.” _. no kiddin'?you mean a <b><u>popularity contest</u></b> turns out to be like a <b><u>popularity contest</u></b>.  i'll be damned.. you're not <b><u>wrong</u></b>.. <b><u>tenure</u></b> > <b><u>attractive</u></b>, any day. promote these large nostrils and

assume that <b><u>universities</u></b> hire more poorly qualified non-<b><u>white</u></b> non-<b><u>male</u></b>s over <b><u>better</u></b> qualified <b><u>white</u></b> <b><u>male</u></b>s, whereas in reality, the whole <b><u>point</u></b> of diversity practices in <b><u>hiring</u></b> is to mitigate <b><u>bias</u></b> against <b><u>people</u></b> who are more…see more. <b><u>innokenty kantor</u></b> <b><u>thanks</u></b> for explaining my comment for me. yes be<b><u>cause</u></b> being <b><u>male</u></b> or <b><u>white</u></b> has never been shown to be the <b><u>direct <b><u>cause</u></b></u></b> of very tangible privileges. the <b><u>way</u></b> some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face <b><u>bias</u></b>.. jacq j<b><u>one</u></b>s not at all. i think it is the <b><u>opposite</u></b>: those who think that any disproportion is a result of <b><u>bias</u></b> or discrimination, are just burying their heads in sand. be<b><u>cause</u></b> they don't like the implications.. ransell d'souza he was trying to write 'of course' in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as 'of <b><u>cause</u></b>.' notice he also replaced the <b><u>word</u></b> hire with 'high.' it's probably a combination of using autocorrect and a <b><u>complete lack</u></b> of <b><u>proof</u></b>. <b><u>innokenty kantor</u></b> unless you are already <b><u>hiring</u></b> <b><u>inferior candidates</u></b> who happen to fit your <b><u>bias</u></b> - eg <b><u>white</u></b> men. in which <b><u>case</u></b> expanded the range of <b><u>people</u></b> you consider will enhance the quality of your hires.. what's of <b><u>cause</u></b>?. <b><u>innokenty kantor</u></b> yes, it’s nice (apologies for not getting reference). i’d love to see this extended to include racial <b><u>bias</u></b> be<b><u>cause</u></b>, sadly, i think this would be even more pronounced. and the weighting often put on these for <b><u>tenure</u></b> is <b><u>problematic</u></b> at <b><u>best</u></b>.. <b><u>innokenty kantor</u></b> there seems to be a strong <b><u>correlation</u></b> that <b><u>white</u></b> men don’t believe academia is <b><u>sexist</u></b> and <b><u>racist</u></b> (backed up by <b><u>several studies</u></b>). seems to <b><u>point</u></b> to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field <b><u>bias</u></b>ed towards them,. the most laughable part is the assumption that <b><u>universities</u></b> hire the <b><u>best</u></b> candidate rather than the <b><u>one</u></b> that most closely matches their 'existing culture' (which is really just code for <b><u>bias</u></b>es towards wht they think ideal candidates are like, and the d…see more. issues with the methodology but not news.. i don’t even look anymore. you must not be an adjunct. i don’t want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs i apply to every <b><u>year</u></b>. well, i get three out of four.. that’s how i do it. . wait there are adults who actually care about what's written on <b><u>rate</u></b>my<b><u>professor</u></b>?. no of you should ever, under any circumstances, read <b><u>rate</u></b> my <b><u>professor</u></b>. no <b><u>good</u></b> comes of it.  and i firmly believe there should be a “<b><u>rate</u></b> my <b><u>student</u></b>” site. . mirrors typical life. i don't bother with the actual university evaluations let al<b><u>one</u></b> this garbage.. ditto. especially after reading a rape fantasy.. i hope you reported that.. <b><u>bob borrelli</u></b> why? so they can all laugh about it? pick up lines, graphic sexual fantasies, sexual assault and notes like “pretty <b><u>sure</u></b> i found your house” were totally ignored.. ta-shana this kind of stuff al<b><u>way</u></b>s makes me think of you.. you brought it to our attention <b><u>year</u></b>s ago. <b><u>white</u></b>? yes. <b><u>male</u></b>? no. <b><u>tenure</u></b>d? hahaha. <b><u>attractive</u></b>? um.... brenna e. culbert. my favorite comment on <b><u>rmp</u></b> was “she has a <b><u>lot</u></b> of patience, even with the stupid <b><u>question</u></b> <b><u>people</u></b>.”. amanda evert they repeated your <b><u>study</u></b>.. sarina kilham. <b><u>thanks</u></b>. adding it to my stockpile of evidence.. hadil gh<b><u>one</u></b>im here you go.. i'm <b><u>attractive</u></b> though . <b><u>white</u></b>? yes. <b><u>male</u></b>? yes? <b><u>tenure</u></b>d? no. <b><u>attractive</u></b>? not really. my <b><u><b><u>rmp</u></b> rating</u></b>s still suck, although i have a few <b><u>good</u></b> <b><u>one</u></b>s.. jess moore, the most frequent descriptor <b><u>people</u></b> use for me is 'boring'. that <b><u>one</u></b> cuts me to my soul. i'm fun!. <b><u>brian paul</u></b> i agree and my ratings are largely <b><u>good</u></b>, and even the '<b><u>negative</u></b> <b><u>one</u></b>s' are worthwhile . <b><u>brian paul</u></b> i just got a <b><u>bad</u></b> review for giving too <b><u>much</u></b> work for a minimester <b><u>class</u></b>. i'm not even <b><u>sure</u></b> how to take that. am i supposed to assign less work during a minimester? i was told you're supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now i wonder about that.. aurora le well shit. ami sedani new <b><u>study</u></b>! more like duh lol.  lisa parker lebovitz. daniel malcom <b><u>thanks</u></b>! i’ve got to get back to the data, i think we can refute this. maybe the young <b><u>white</u></b> <b><u>male</u></b> faculty aren’t as <b><u>attractive</u></b> to

there be <b><u>better</u></b> references, not of those written ages ago when they used sophisticated <b><u>word</u></b>s'<b><u>cause</u></b> who comes to university to learn sophisticated

you link the math paper using <b><u>emoji</u></b>? that would be awesome and i'd like to read it.this is a <b><u>good</u></b> <b><u>one</u></b> about <b><u>emoji</u></b>, but it's not written in it, though it has some examples of retelling. https:// well i am an un<b><u>attractive</u></b>, <b><u>white</u></b> fe<b><u>male</u></b> and get great reviews and teach  a  <b><u>subject</u></b>  that  is considered hard.. perhaps it would be profitable to spend some <b><u>time</u></b> <b><u>study</u></b>ing statistics.. you fulfill <b><u>one</u></b> of the categories, then.. <b><u>good</u></b>foryou. i see you don't understand how studies work. a <b><u>study</u></b> never reports that in 100% of <b><u>case</u></b>s this happens, and in 0% of <b><u>case</u></b>s, this happened. if that were true, providing <b><u>one</u></b> contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the <b><u>study</u></b>.studies look at the <b><u>way</u></b> things tend to be. maybe <b><u>people</u></b> who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but it's not a guarantee <b><u>one</u></b> <b><u>way</u></b> or the other still.. funny: race and <b><u>gender</u></b> are  less important than <b><u>attractive</u></b>ness, <b><u>student</u></b> interest and discipline, but the first two features in the headline is “<b><u>white</u></b>” and “<b><u>male</u></b>”. stop contradicting the <b><u>fact</u></b>s with your divisive ideology!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. <b><u><b><u>juan trucupey</u></b> cool story bro</u></b>. catherine glass it’s easy to laugh when you’re the beneficiary. <b><u>juan trucupey</u></b> that’s not contradicting <b><u>fact</u></b>s. it’s emphasising some things that the <b><u>study</u></b> found more than others. but i bet the standard of <b><u>attractive</u></b>ness and <b><u>gender</u></b> interact as well. juan yes it's all propaganda; it's not like they're just <b><u>point</u></b>ing out the most interesting conclusions of the <b><u>study</u></b> rather than the obvious <b><u>one</u></b>s. <b><u>student</u></b> interest in the <b><u>subject</u></b> influences <b><u>professor</u></b> ratings? really? . <b><u>juan trucupey</u></b> you're the <b><u>one</u></b> who is claiming that it is <b><u>sexist</u></b> against <b><u>male</u></b>s to imply that <b><u>gender</u></b> affects ratings before listing a <b><u>student</u></b>'s interest in the <b><u>subject</u></b> matter. i never said that. so your complaint that i'm contradicting myself is <b><u>wrong</u></b> - i…see more. propaganda, lol.. i literally have had fe<b><u>male</u></b> <b><u>student</u></b>s look for profs who are called a <b><u>bit</u></b>ch. it apparently means something different to <b><u>people</u></b>. <b><u>good</u></b> to know. those <b><u>student</u></b>s just graduating with phds now, <b><u>one</u></b> went to georgetown, another is a teacher.. matthew lucky 3/4 ain't <b><u>bad</u></b> "
