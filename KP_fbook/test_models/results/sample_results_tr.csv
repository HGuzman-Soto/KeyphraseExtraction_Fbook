0,"Alex Epstein, the author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, considers the details of the Green New Deal.","Kudos to all the commenters who came before me for pointing out exactly where Prager gets its funding from.  I assume that Jocko will be banging down my door any minute now.... PragerU is funded by oil billionaires, this is blatant propaganda 😂. Cole Bell no, it’s facts. Everything he said was facts. Most people are clueless or willfully ignorant when it comes to energy production ' transmission.Nothing has advanced or bettered the lives of humans more than fossil fuels, ever - it’s literall…See More. Shannon Wagner I'm all for nuclear energy for the most part, but I think we need to invest in Nuclear Fusion and try to make Fission obsolete. Fission can certainly be harmful to the environment in different ways, even though the energy is clean. As fo…See More. Are we gonna just ignore that oil companies lobbied against actual science for years back in the 50s, 60s and 70s so they could avoid regulation? Nice try oil lobbyists.. Our plan has been around for 7 billion years and as seen many changes in the climatein that period of time. The sands of Africa used to be a rain forest as shown by many fossils. I do not personally feel there is an extreme threat with climate change at all but I do think it.is a way for the powers that are trying to take over running the USA to try to get…See More. Dottie Minnich the planet has been around for 7 billion years and has seen many mass extinctions. We are speeding up the process for the next one. This isn’t a matter of whether the planet will survive, the planet will obviously be fine. It’s habitability for human life is what’s coming into question.. Dottie Minnich Literally no scientific source says that. The figure is 4.54 billion, accurate to within 50 million. 7 billion years would make the Earth older than the solar system.. There's a big difference between a threat to the planet itself and a threat to the things living on the planet. And I'm not sure who you think the 'powers that are trying to take over running the USA' are, but when I think about people in the US with too much power, oil billionaires are some of the first people that come to mind, and they're the ones telling you not to worry about climate change.. Shawn Lada - I'd rather not look at AOC. Her real name is Sandy and I think she's a leftist- Completely.🙃 People like her would bring great harm the United States of America.🇺🇸 I do think it's a good idea to cut down on our carbon usage but look it up…See More. No it's not. Look at AOC. She isnt a establishment Democrat. She wrote the bill to solve every problem we have that would impact the environment. If you actually understood the sciences of greenhouse gases and how we are defrosting all of the trees, th…See More. Dottie Minnich Citation needed. No seriously, I give you credit for admitting where you were wrong once, but you gotta do it quite a bit more because, well, you're dead wrong. Sandy? Wtf. If you want to know what a couple of fracking billionaires think of the Green New Deal, I suppose watch. But at least know who pays for PragerU's funding.. David Wright or anyone with common sense or knowledge on energy production🤷🏻_♂️.... Bruh, you’re bankrolled by the fracking industry.This is widely available information.. This video goes to prove that the 'smart' and 'highly educated' are infact, not.. Kyle Egelhoff Im literally talking about solar panels being good. I mentioned solar batteries becuase solar panels can have batteries connected to them so they have extra charge for when the sun isn't shining- becuase the video completly ignored the fact that the power generated by solar panels could be stored and used later.. Your house runs on AC current not DC current. You can not store AC current in batteries. The energy in the powerlines are AC because it can travel farther then DC before losing energy. Yes it can be converted between the two, but there is always a loss…See More. Solar panels currently power american homes, I don't know why you are talking about solar panels like they are some impossible dream. This page is literally sponsored by the Koch brothers and other oil barons. PLEASE do your own research and don't trust these grifters.. NO GREEN DEAL..PERIOD... Betty Nana good to see you're keeping an open mind.. Betty Nana which one are you in the photo, the lady with the white hair in the center?. 'The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels' LMAO. Just so everyone knows, most of PragerU's early funding came from Dan and Farris Wilkes. Two brothers who started a fracking company. There is a reason PragerU shills for the fossil fuel industry.. Prager U would support hitler as long as he used fossil fuels at Aushwitz. We don't cotton to folks of the Epstein ilk round these parts no more, take yourself out SIR. bah!  Within ten years we'll be 100 percent wind, and solar!  Ray Kurzweil said so.. Our beaches are eroding and we have lost lots of island nations do to the rising water and sea levels. Aren't yall funded by the Koch Brothers lmao.. The deal with the green new deal is Prager has his head up his ass.. PragerU is funded by fossil fuel billionaires the Wilks brothers. Are you telling me a person whose entire funding is based on fossil fuels is against a plan that moves away from fossil fuels?. The fact that he said nuclear energy is the safest form of energy is actually hilarious I guess they don't know about Chernobyl incident and how it was one of the worst nuclear disaster in human history or how fossil fuels are a leading cause of global…See More.

Oscar Wilhelmy nuclear energy is dangerous it could literally destroy a whole country or a city. It bothers me how people's entire perception of nuclear energy is based primarily on the failures of two or three specific locations: Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011), and Three Mile Island (1979, if you're in the US). France's energy grid is around …See More. This is how you know Prager is a toxic sellout media outlet!. What “moral case” for fossil fuels? There is no moral case for fossil fuels. Any relation to the other Epstein?. There are many scientists that don't agree. This is about Obama billions of dollars inestments and all  crap going on today.. They aren't even an educational institute. I see that oil money is being put to good use by ya'll eh?. Some talking head paid by the oil lobby, man I'm so interested on his thoughts on Greene energy and fossil fuels! I can imagine they align with, fossil fuel good green energy bad, even though it's a growing industry. How are you going to power New York City? 10billion wind turbines?! Store the energy in a battery the size of a building?  Nuclear is the future folks!. WE ARE ALREADY  USING RECYCLED MATERIALS FROM THE EARTH THAT WORK PRETTY WELL!. If oil companies are so profitable, why do they STILL need to be subsidized? China is going to be ahead of us because they're moving to better sources of energy faster, while the oil companies in the US fund idiots like  Prager U to spread propaganda and  keep them in business, so they won't have to keep up with the times. They profit short-term, the entire country loses in the long term.. PragerU is not a real university.. Hey all you believe green new deal so much. How many of you want to chip and buy me a Cyber truck. Otherwise im gunna need gas still. I'm just impressed by the mental gymnastics and rhetorical tapdancing on display here. Well, that and this dude's perpetual constipated look.. funny how i see this video just as there’s floods in mexico, texas, china, and india .... the earth is getting tired of our bullshit. because of people like this we’re all going to go extinct.. Shilling for the destruction of our planet and extinction of ours and many other species, anything for the almighty dollar, your one true god right?. Hey Prager U where'd'ja get the money for this video?. So CO2 is the reason for longer life expectancy and not modern medicine and a deeper understanding of modern science 🤔 seems legit.. Oil companies have time and money to transition into clean energy companies, but they're not going to do that until they sell every drop of oil!. You never know. There was an oil billionaire who said, 'We didn't leave the stone age because we ran out of stone' so there's definitely some trying to get the jump.. You almost have to respect PragerU for this video. Most right wing media propaganda will tell you that rise in co2 levels are a hoax or something like that. But they lean into it. Not only are they rising but that’s good. It makes “global greening.” Don’t worry about where Florida went, now we grow corn at the North Pole. You win some you lose some.. Daniel Podesta the best lies contain some truth in them.. C'mon, commenters. Do you really think the fracking billionaire-funded organization is intentionally trying to mislead the public? It's not like this is part of a consistent misinformation campaign spearheaded by the very people falsely claiming to be climate experts.Oh wait... https:''features.weather.com'course-climate-misinformation'. In these times when the American right is actually gaining credibility and making intellectually sound arguments against the crazed out left, the right's denial on climate brings all of that credibility back down. We should stop listening to people who take a narrative driven stance, right or left. Listen to people who consistently take a data driven stance. Data = truth.. The data is that Solar and Wind is ineffective and wastes more materials and kills more wildlife respectively.The data is that The Green New Deal has nothing to do with conserving the Environment.. https:''youtu.be'1zrejG-WI3U. Climate deniers are stupid mfers.. A lot of people on here informing us that Prager is funded by oil lobbiests, but no one providing information on why the information is false.. Valerie Cihak I didnt even watch the video and I can summarize it for you. Either they are claiming the science isnt there to prove C02 has an impact on the warming of the earth or humans aren't as responsible for it. Either way it's just propaganda. Conservatives and Libertarians are too goddamned stupid to fact check anything, and expect others to provide them with information they're not interested in, and will refuse to believe no matter how well documented the facts are.. Love getting information from a dude who wrote for the Ayn Rand Institute and was funded by the Koch brothers speaking in a video by a right wing think tank that is funded by fracking billionaires and exists solely to spew corporate propaganda 👍🏻. https:''www.youtube.com'watch?v=VxWYglbtqnQ. Elijah White No one's saying that the world is *literally* going to end in 12 years.The more salient point is that we have a 12 year window to prevent a large amount of warming that will cost us a significant amount of money over the next 100 years.. Idk why everyone thinks this is a great idea this is why so many states always vote red because everytime democrats get in a lot of republicans lose their jobs without a new job in site they should really add the jobs first then start the process of moving people to the new jobs or red will continue to vote red for not only that reason but several more. Lmao why do y'all wanna fight so hard for shitty coal jobs? If you put half that energy into moving forward we'd be much closer to a world of plenty.. Good to see a majority of people don't buy into Prager's bullshit--literal propaganda machine based on nothing but common ignorance's ability to believe whatever pops up on the news feed.. 'Thank you oil daddies for all the oil money! we'll be sure to bash anything close to reigning in your blood thirsty practices'- PragerU. Currently 66 very clueless, or very stupid people laughing at this. He is 100% correct. I work in the energy industry, and I know what it entails. It’s not as simple as so many brainwashed people think it is. And the climate “threat” leftists keep talking about is next to nothing - it’s a manufactured crisis just like every other corrupt Leftist cause.. Shannon Wagner Agenda 21. What about hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and nuclear power? Wind and solar are only 2 options.. Ryan Hathaway it framed the comment about 'no country being even 50%' and led the audience the believe that meant renewable. Two countries have reached 100% renewable but they didn't EXCLUSIVELY use wind and solar. It's just short of being a lie.. Nuclear, geothermal, geomagnetic. You missed a few green energies. Ryan Kish did you actually watch the video? He clearly talks about Nuclear energy and it's part.. Matt Clodfelter meant more towards thorium should have been little more specific.

16,Its true...,"So very true.. https:''www.instagram.com'p'CAvkkj_ncLJ'.... Lindsey Clawson. Danaya deleted. Lindsey Clawson posting a picture from another country, to explain your police brutality statement, doesn’t. How about showing it in our own country. We cannot fix another countries issues until we fix our own. I find it super interesting that out of the hundreds of pictures you could have picked. You chose a picture from another country? Why? Because it has a child in it? Do you know the story behind this picture?. Dexter Hendrix omg how do I share that!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. https:''youtu.be'CTTEdXCTFNc. I thought changing the colors of the flag was a no no?🤔🤦🤣🤣. Jeff Lufkin it is.. Yep. Those people are dense.. Dexter Hendrix must be a Trump supporter?? Lmao. Jeff Lufkin It is a copy of an American flag (notice no red and white stripes?  No blue background with white stars?).  It is legal...and protected by the First Amendment...and (radically) it supports the police.  Sorry I have to point out the blindingly obvious.... Even though the flag on the right violates the flag code?. Doug Palmer interesting.. Dexter Hendrix , 'you're' not your. And the law is on the books. Do you usually choose which laws you are going to obey?. section 8 for those of you uneducated about respecting our flag.https:''uscode.house.gov'view.xhtml.... Jennifer Shay-Velzy. Renee Fasano first of all it’s not funny second of all it’s not English class and third of all it’s not running my mouth it’s expressing my opinion, i also was correcting someone, you probably should just scroll on. Johnny Lindal I didnt come here to argue just to correct someone running their mouth lmao. This is why my family is safe, but cops keep TONS of people safe and do a very selfless job I for one am grateful for them!. Idk. Washington state patrol sue spends a lot of time pulling people of for speeding when they could be doing something about the ferrel citizens in Seattle. Seems like a waste of money to me. Seth that’s what Washington state patrol is for 🤦🏻♂️ Maybe figure out the difference between state patrol, city cops and sheriff’s before you comment.. No I need to stop getting caught speeding 😉. Seth Linde makes soo much revenue tho. THeir quotas i mean goals are set so high.. Stop speeding. Ahh yess, political shitposting. Thanks to folks such as yourself in this group, this is what Maple Valley is known for. How disappointing.. Gwen nope we can’t control people, places or things. People will be whatever they want, he can practice his 1st how ever he chooses, Ive live in this community long before you were alive and a post like this is the least of maple valleys problems. Seth Linde ah I don’t anymore at this point if I’m honest. This page is literally a laughing stock to other community groups in different cities. Gwen Dumaran It's not political. It's just the truth.. Gwen Dumaran I meant the “being able to take pride in your community”. Gwen Dumaran it also shows how many garbage people moved here so there's that too. Ew. It’s not defacing the flag.  It would have to be an American flag to be defacing it.  It is not an American flag.  If you want to talk about disrespecting the flag - driving around wit a flag on your truck - when the flag is shredding- that is disredpectful. Jeremy Bigford that is fine - but when they are torn or ripped'shredded that is disrespectsble. Just call them at 2am when a guy tries to come in your house and see how long it takes the cops to get there. Sad truth is that they will come but they come to call a clean up crew or take someone's statement. The only one protecting you is you! I'm not saying we don't need cops but saying that they always protect you is nonsense.. Thomas Geissler so true. Flags are why we are free and safe?Holy cow, go figure!And all along I thought is was Americans from all walks of life that struggled, voted, and acted as individuals and one people for a good life for themselves and a better life for their children.…See More. Dexter, what unit did you serve in?. Trust me I’ve heard it all from the Navy guys - no respect 😂If I knew you were an army grunt I would have let it go - there are some real punk-ass bitches on here sometimes.  I think everyone should serve, or work in foodservice - then there would be less problems 😂🤣😂. Rachel Tallon did you have to serve in order to have those thoughts?. Huh? I served in the 3rd Infantry Division.. Christopher M Paulsen My best buds created and run a company called RWD technologies...ALL are Coast Guard Academy graduates.  Great guys.  Trust me, they had more army shit than I had coast guard shit, them fuckers.  Anyone on the water stays tuned to channel 16...their heroes.. Aylen Ponze look at this🥴. I like the orange (SAR) and  red (Fire) stripe flags. Alot of this conversation is funny. hilarious threads...comedy gold...my fav is the guy correcting my punctuation while he swears the flag with a blue stripe is illegal and a disgrace!

21,"5653. Whoever wrote 5606 I think I know who you are talking about because they dined and dashed on me because I was against the revolution. I was friends with these two girls and one guy freshman year. They asked me what my parents did and I said they both were nurses, and that I was on financial aid. Mind you, my mom is a school nurse and makes nowhere near the amount of hospital nurses.  From then on, they began treating me differently. Suddenly they would hang out without ...me and I know they should talk a lot of shit about how I was rich. One day I ran out of money on my metrocard downtown in a station where there were no machines. I asked if I could borrow a swipe and I would repay them for it. I was cursed out on the middle of the platform because it was apparently rude to offer them money just because they were poor. I didn't understand why it was rude because I would have given anyone the 2.75 and knew nothing about his financial situation. When I said that he told me to stop lying and refused to speak to me on the entire ride home.  A few weeks later, we all went to an all you can eat sushi place in Queens and I was really excited. We went and ate a bunch because it was pretty pricy (like 40 bucks a person) plus some of us got beers too. Both of my female friends decided to go to the bathroom and then I was alone with my guy friend. Things were still weird between us and after a few minutes, he said he was going to check on our other friends. When I offered to go with him, he said I shouldn't because the wait staff needed to know that we didn't dine and dash. So he left and then I was alone at the table to only find out that they all dined and dashed me.  They texted me that they left me with the bill because of how mad my male friend was as a result of the metrocard thing. They mentioned something about how my actions showed that I was against the revolution. I shit you not paying someone back in their minds is anti-communist. It literally made no sense. I tried paying the entire bill which was well over 200 with tip and tax, but my card only had around 80 dollars on it because I had paid for a textbook earlier that day. I had to wait an hour and a half in the restaurant sobbing until my parents could come down from New Jersey and give me the rest of the money. One of them had the audacity to wish me a happy birthday the next week.  I've heard from other people on campus that they've done this kind of stuff to them too. They're fully a group of uneducated people who think they're swindling the rich by actually fucking over their peers, who aren't even wealth. I didn't think people actually did this crap before it happened to me, but apparently they do.","Yo is this real ?. Nigel Telman. I wonder if later those people were praising first responders saving lives during COVID outbreak, sharing pictures of nurses with angel wings etc))). drop the @‘s.

Every unique art form is an outlet for artists to share their emotions, feel...ings, and their own story.

24,"Homeowners are about to get hit with a big new fee: Starting next month, all home mortgages that are refinanced will have to pay half of 1% of the loan upfront — as much as $1,500 for a $300,000 mortgage.","My refinance is already well underway. So hopefully I should be able to avoid this.. Jebadiah Stonewall Bacon - push your LO and processor you get you closed and funded by the end of the month!. You should be good.  If you're just doing a regular refi and have no issues with your paperwork, it shouldn't take more than two weeks to close.. So glad my refinance literally finished today and is being funded on Monday..... I got mine approved last month, thank goodness. Bummer. I was planning on refinancing in the near future. Luckily this will not be a huge barrier for me but it will definitely give me a reason to reconsider moving forward with refinancing.. You already have to pay closing costs when you refinance.. Refinancing for cash out and paying off high interest debt  is also a no win situation with IRS tax laws changed under quiet tax reforms of three years ago.. “And they say banks and other lenders are making record profits on refinanced loans, so they don't necessarily have to pass along the added cost to homeowners.”That is hysterical.. Keith Esterly it's not a bug of capitalism, it's a feature.. So don't refinance. Even without the new fee, it takes years to make up the other fees that they always charged, even with a lower rate. Just keep plugging away at the original mortgage.. Debbie Fromer We’re saving $600 a month by refinancing because rates have changed so, so much since we bought our house. It will take less than 2 years to recoup the cost of the refinance, which was rolled into the loan anyway so we only have to worry about that if we sell in the next 2 years. It can absolutely be worth it.. Debbie Fromer silly you. Are that figures into the spread. You seem like you really don’t understand simple finance. Spread is what your current all in cost is vs what your new all in cost is. I hate to think you believe yourself capable to advise people on refi.. Debbie Fromer Some people have no other choice right now.. Debbie Fromer I get the feeling you don't really know what you're talking about.. The rates are so low that refinancing helps those who need it the most (by lowering their payments). Refinancing actually makes it more likely they won't need to default, so the reasoning is crap.. Yeah that's not helpful if you already did lol. Debbie Fromer May or may not have been a great deal, but I chose a higher interest rate than offered in order to have the lender credits to cover all closing costs.  I wanted to be ahead from day one.. Debbie Fromer   Why aren’t the red blooded Mercans with their 2A righteousness not out shooting Mitch an The Donald and anyone else standing in the way of Freedumb ?. Joe Dufour, plus the other bank charges. The $1500 is only one of them.. Mikel Podgursky McLaughlin, what does “walked away with $500 at closing mean?“ Does that mean you only paid $500 in fees to refinance?. not always true....depends on how old the loan is and the rate;. Yes, I shouldnt cut my term nor my rate in half because you told me so. What you're saying is misleading.  It greatly depends on what rate you're paying versus what your new rate will be.  And if you're refi'ing with a trustworthy company, they'll let you know if its worth it financially.  I refi'd last month and went from…See More. as a loan officer...this sucks, but i understand it's because they are expecting lots of foreclosures soon...... So don't let people lower their payments so they might be able to avoid default? Makes total sense 🙄. Govt supported company raises fees during a pandemic...nothing more American that this.. Well that should be cut into the housing market.. Marty Birch , only on refi’s.. Marty Birch not if you read the article.. “all home mortgages that are refinanced”. Refinance your car first. My interest went down 1.25% by switching to a local credit union. Plus, the process pushed a payment back a month which means a lot to us “little people”.. Such a crock. We’re not making enough off of you for doing nothing, so if you try to cut into our income, we will find you and charge you. Meanwhile, as your bank, we will provide less service to you as we strive to be more efficient to our shareholder…See More. Now is the time to help ppl, not attach more fees to something they're already paying for. Mortgage Rate down,so they get  money from you , another way. I am so thankful I don’t have a Mortgage anymore.. It's all for profits. It always has been.. Sounds more like a prepayment penalty....what BS. Aside: are homeowners who are in the market to refinance right now really the people who need relief the most?. Kenny Satterlee it was with the current lender. Carl Beutler  yes!. Carl Beutler refinancing isn’t relief.. Keith Esterly it can be relief if their payments drop a few hundred dollars.... a matter of individual perspective. Carl Beutler The fee wasn't charged until now.. Ilana Weisel I would say it’s arguably one of the best parts of Obama’s TARP initiative were modifications! I hope it worked out for you!. Big deal. Over the life of a 15-30 year mortgage, this fee is a drop in the hat when you actually consider the difference paid between a 4 or 5% interest rate vs. a 2.5 or 3% interest rate.Refinance. While you're at it, refinance to a 15 year.. Kristin Schultz The fee is often required to be paid up front when refinancing. That can be thousands in cash that many people simply don’t have right now.. Thanks Trump.  You pick only the best people.. So if you have excess money and dont neex a refinance....theyll refinance you. One more knife in the back of the middle and lower class. That's really not that bad considering... even so, I would challenge it in court if it isnt explicitly in the contract. Brian McCarten yeah 👏. Considering what?. Considering most of the country doesnt own a 300,000 house and even if they did 1,500 isnt that much compared to the money saved on the life of the mortgage.... “.... Trump administration-appointed regulators at the Federal Housing Finance Agency who approved the new fee.”. Mari Mari yep, no surprise. Leave it to Trump!. Dang!  Looks like we refi'd just in time!  Closed about a month ago.  Got a nice 2.99 on a 30-year.. Can anyone explain why they aren't saying '.5 % of the loan' and are saying 'half of 1 %'?. Average Americans don't math.. Mark Flanagan false. Please try again.. Nate Sullivan trish better not bump this into September!. Sam Cruz Jr. Will this happen to me?. Matt Grieger. David Bannister. Cammy Donnen. Laura Mast. Sounds like my fee may be around $600? If I did the math correctly?. Jimena Rojas Amurrio something to think about. Let Flor know.. Matthew Fante-Becker.

AntiBlackness accumulates matierality for white and/or non-Black people through exporting gratutious violence against Blackness. This means for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, the matierality that we have (regardless of how much) is indivisibly tied to the rendering fungible, dispossession, and eradication of Blackness that is integral to the antagonism of antiBlackness. Given this, and as one small piece in the larger nessecary commitment to aiding Black liberation, it means that for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, we must redistribute the matierality that we have back to Black people by any means nessecary!!!

And the parents can come too, be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it's their turn. I'll see 15 children a day.. So many wonderful people in healthcare. And then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with. They think the whole workforce is to meet their standard. There are many occupations that deserve equal respect…See More. Saddle Rivera When DJT’s kid goes back to school & when he opens back up the White House then we’ll know that it’s safe!.

James Troutman, I honestly think he'd make his kid go to school like his buddy Putin had his daughter take a 2nd Phase Covid Vaccine. Btw, did Trump's younger brother just die of Covid after Trump had him take the hydroxychloroquine. Just thinkin. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Nick LaCerva she probably doesn't care... Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. 👍... this is just a Trumpie ...NTY gives space to Cotton, Newsweek to that old lawyer and The Atlantic to this nurse .... SAME ..... I’ve been a teacher, healthcare worker now.Stop giving nurses so much attention 😎. Jacki Webb 💯%. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Andrew Hsieh this. 💯. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.   If it  is  not  safe  for  football,  theaters,  and  innperson in person meetings,  kids  do  not  need  to  go  to in  person  school.. Angie Johnson Krivchenia True. But the administration wants the economy back rather than safety from COVID. 'It is what it is...' Trump.. So I have been a nurse for over 40 years, still working in a hospital. I know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe.  Teachers are educators and don't need to put their safety at risk and be exposed to Covid, period. Teachers shoul…See More. It's not their work, it's who they work with. Kids and families and all the other people out of the house because schools are open (so parents can work) and in risk of infection. A nurse just stays in hospital waiting for sick people to go to them. Even in lockdown.. I guess that nurse wants to keep “doing her job” because kids going to school is going to make more sick patients.. Also, that’s the dumbest thing I’ve heard.. I kinda feel sorry for her husband.. The difference is that Nurses save lives when they show up to work. Teachers coming in will cause more people to end up at the hospital. How does that help you, Nurse?. You chose healthcare and the potential risk that came with it. Teachers chose education and the lower risk of being exposed to kids with sniffles. Big difference.. Said what I said... this is a cold human being PERIOD. Cant compare nurses with teachers. THATS the point..... Hess Reunion umm I never attended the university of Phoenix. I have a masters in special education and a license in elementary, alternative and secondary social studies. What’s your point.. Hess Reunion and I’m a NP.....I’d also like to know your point?. Anthony Jason Warren I don’t disagree. At least they are only having brief interactions...but still.. Leigh Taylor haters are gonna hate... Let’s pay teachers what nurses and doctors make first, and then we can have this discussion. Also let’s make sure teachers have other staff to do all the cleaning too, and then again, we can have that discussion.. Hardly, there is liability in every job and because of that, you get trained to deal with that liability. People who choose to work in 'dangerous' professions, know what they are signing up for when they enrolled in school. Teaching is not meant to be …See More. Schools are not funded like hospitals.  Ours is not air-conditioned, with poor air circulation, no way to social distance and in a small space for 7 hours I a day with little kids who may or may not be wearing a mask. Nurses keep people alive. In person school isn't worth anyone's life. Not teachers ', not students', not parents', not grandparents'.. As a nurse, people rely on you to help them get better when they're sick. In other words: if you don't do your job, they might die and they have to see you in person in order for you to help them. You cannot treat people for Covid-19 remotely.As a tea…See More. Bullshit. The kids aren't in going to school because their lives are in danger. In fact, going to school can and WILL put their lives at risk, and especially the teachers. The teachers' efforts aren't saving the lives of their students.Also... PPE...…See More. and just in case anyone thinks kids aren't at risk, we've already had multiple outbreaks around the country because of KIDS! Kids going to camp, kids going back to school, kids doing sports... This is the most absurd argument for public health I've ever heard in my life!. And patients aren't grouped together in one room. Can you imagine having 20 patients in one room and trying to keep them from being exposed to each other.  And kids aren't in bed they're up running around. There is no comparison.. They should be given the proper tools to do their job. Historically, this has not happened.. The Atlantic we’re in the midst of a public health emergency and y’all look like clowns publishing this opinion-based nonsense. signed, a covid icu nurse who doesn’t want to risk unnecessary exposure for teachers and families. See the thing is, she *chose* the healthcare field knowing the risk of exposure to communicable diseases; teachers chose the field of education to *educate* people.  The thing about opinions is that they are like assholes...everybody has one...and some actually *are* one.  Let me guess...she’s one of those “nurses” that doesn’t believe in vaccines and has an essential oil for everything 🙄. Kristin Humbles so by her (mis)logic, I would be led to assume that nurse who care for children who are hospitalized also teach whatever lessons their classmates are being taught in school that day.. Kristin Humbles it is.. Ron it is the comment section after all 🤷♀️. ...wtf, so everyone needs to expose themselves to the risk of sacrificing themselves or family members for the good of the masses?. Teachers can teach remotely. Nurses generally need to be in the company of patients.. No. Health care workers agreed to work in health care. Teachers did not.. So you, as a nurse, can be overwhelmed again? Logic? You do realize nothing about the virus has changed, right?. a teachers job is not to put their lives on the line bc a country doesn't have adequate familial support to allow people to quit their jobs and shelter in their house with their families. jesus america is scary. The issue is not only are teachers and other staff —and their families-exposed to a potentially deadly illnesss but so are schoolchildren—and their families.  And anyone who comes into contact with them.  What the nation needs now is a nation wide stay…See More. I don't want my kids to go to school. I'll deal with the distance learning. Schools can't seem to manage bullying. Imagine bullying by exposing kids to Covid? Teachers can teach through Zoom ... Protect themselves as well ... & I am a healthcare worker. How many nurses, doctors and staff died? People have to go to hospitals. Kids don't have to go to a building in a crowd and become little carriers.. Can a nurse do their job remotely? Regrettably, no. There are jobs that most be done in person.Teaching can be done online. “You gotta do it because I had to do it.” is lazy thinking.. I signed up to teach kids.

89,The Trump administration plans to withdraw William Perry Pendley as its nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management. Pendley has faced criticism for past statements in support of selling off federal public land.,"his nominees are always the antithesis of what they are charged to oversee and protect.  Always.. Catherine, that’s his idea, destroy from Within.  DeVos is a clear example.. Destructionists. yep, look at Dejoy and Devos.. Jerry JB I agree Jerry. It’s going to take a long time to undo the damage, if that’s possible. I was an NRA member and took Hunter Safety courses. Now it’s all about the Benjamins. Pretty sad.. Catherine Howard exactly. Yes. I wonder why only this time, the criticism caused a withdrawal.. Catherine Howard Deconstruction is still the plan.. Jerry JB completely agree.. TRUE!! In fact...they are there to DESTROY  what their in charge of!! Every one of them!!. Justin Parton true that.. Catherine Howard That's a fact! He is evil!. Catherine Howard ALWAYS. Well said. Catherine Howard absolutely true. And his idea of protect means: make money off of.... Justin Parton Correct, hunting and hunters fund a large portion of conservation efforts.  Not all hunters are crazy MAGA 2nd Amendment nuts.  For a lot of people in this country, hunting is an important tradition and equates to spending time with and learning from family.  As long as you’re responsible and respectful, hunting can be seen as more respectable than just buying slaughter house fodder.. Catherine Howard   always. Catherine Howard It’s almost like him and his followers hate America.. Jerry JB I have yet to meet ANYONE who didn't have an ancestor who was a hunter. I'm 67 years old. Well, if you break an agency, you can say that it doesn't work and sunset it.. Catherine Howard So true.. Catherine Howard exactly!!!. Catherine Howard Yeah. Like getring one of the most ignorant people he knows to run the Department of Education. What's up with that? Those are the 'very best people' he pledged to help run his administration? Really?. Catherine Howard Cruella DeVilles every one.. Catherine Howard exactly.. Catherine Howard I’m waiting for him to appoint Farmer John to head the Union of Orthodox Rabbis.. Catherine Howard That is the plan of this administration, to dismantle all the departments and destroy the U.S. as we know it.  That’s why all the wolves are put in charge of the hen houses.. This is good news but may just mean that he’s knows he won’t get approved. Pendley is already acting director so my guess is Trump will keep him on till the end of his term to do as many evil deeds as possible.. Daniel Collay it’s political theater. Odds are good Trump will lose, so what’s the point of filling a post for a few months at best?. Which just means he has found someone equally unqualified.. Or worse.. Barbara Havens Joe Exotic?. All public lands and the natural resources therein should first supplement old age pension and public healthcare.  And held in perpeturity  for this purpose.. John Kimball Great idea, try getting current politicians to do it!. This is a start, but he must be REMOVED, and not allowed to remain as acting director. Tell your elected representatives.. Raising hell MATTERS! Keep marching, keep contacting elected officials!. Selling off our federal lands would be a huge mistake… They are our national heritage and draw tourists from all over the world. I’m sure he’ll have a new nominee just as bad if not worse.. For those of us with short memories due to his chaotic leadership, the damage started long before this guy. https:''thehill.com'...'421910-undoing-the-damage-pruitt.... Carol Perry Macholl As I stated earlier, remove ANY politician that has served more than 8 years! Nancy, Chuck, etc. They have already become multimillionaires AT OUR expense.. In not so many months, all of the clown’s nominations will be in the unemployment line.. Randy Jeffers Who would “your man” nominate? AOC, Bernie, Omar, Or some other radical fool?. Most likely a legitimate authority on land management. I know, radical, huh? I'm glad you've clarified that stuffing your pockets at the expense of the people is now the mainstream conservative ethos.. Why is Trump even nominating anyone for any position right now? He has no idea whether he’ll have a second term (let’s hope not). By the time anyone gets confirmed, it would be just about time to vacate their office when Trump gets escorted out of the White House.. What?  He found somebody worse?  Less qualified?  More interested in gutting the land, air, and water than this twit?  Wow!. Kudrun Pilegrim nah, just a bigger donor.... You win. Kudrun Pilegrim no, the guy remains in the job and continues to lead without senate confirmation. Just another end run around congress.. Probably just decided he was needed more over at the USPS.. Melissa Erwin - Nah; He just hasn’t got to fire anyone yet this month!. Good call! 🍊🤡 definitely can’t have someone that could take the spotlight from his citrusy visage, the Divider-in-Chief, Master of Polarization!! 🤣😂. We not gonna talk about how he looks like an alternate reality Joe Exotic....like if he went to college and got an office job..... James A. Barnes yes!. James A. Barnes More like Joe Chaotic.. Yes!. So now they’re going to find someone else who doesn’t have easily discoverable statements in support of selling off federal land?. Exactly.  Since when has anybody who left the Trump administration been replaced by somebody more capable and less corrupt than the temporary appointee that couldn't even pass congressional approve if Mitch had been doing his job?. Andrew Chipperfield true. HOW ARE THERE STILL POSITIONS TO NOMINATE?! The term ends in January!. Javier Iñón People said the same thing in 2016.. 4 years later and he still can't get the job done he promised us would be done by April 2017.What a terrible leader.. Most federal agencies are being run by 'acting' appointments because Trump knows he can't get them confirmed.. very different year.. The Trump administration holds the record for the most unfilled positions. Majority is being run by temps. He’ll just hire a guy that thinks the same but hasn’t talked about it publicly. Don’t even start to think he’s changing his mind about selling off land. He’s just going to sneak it through.. good.  but the fact trump even considered him is yet another reason to VOTE in historical numbers this Nove to remove him.... He must not have donated enough to Donny's campaign.. Jan Moody Garner both sides take lobbyists money silly. Jan Moody Garner. Just another corrupt wealthy Trump supporter put in place to help his own business in exchange for an illegal campaign donation that somehow landed in Trump’s personal bank account.  The Republican Senate is too impotent to stop it.  Swampy swampy swampy.. This guy looks like the kind of person who would sell federal land. The bollo just completes the reason not to trust him.. Paul and looks oddly like a bleached and mustached Ted Cruz which is eerily grosser.. They should be rethinking about 100 more of his appointments....... Oh by all means don’t let public criticism of your reign of terror stop you from plundering more irreplaceable public land! Just because your re-election is coming up doesn’t mean you have to suddenly become responsible!. I would like to leave my share of public lands to my children, so they may enjoy the grandeur of this great nation.  I won't sell.  Raise your hand if you agree. 🖐. I’d walk 1000 miles -to vote them all out in 2020 if I had too. Make sure your friends get to the polls.. He must have come up with someone less qualified or another one of his big donors that he promised a job or Jared. Some people loved the way this guy managed land, and others didn’t care for it. I’m sure he’ll find some more land to manage soon enough.. the real takeaway is that 4 months from the end of his term and he still hasn't even settled on appointees to offices.. Most of his selections to head governmental departments are corporate executives whose track records aren’t in the best interest of America.  Where as, that dude looks like he’s from the porn industry.  Specifically, the 70’s - 80’s era.. So he pardoned Joe Exotic and gave him a job?.

It isn't worth the risk to anyone..

There are many occupations that deserve equal respect…See More. Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Pretty sh*tty to pit two professions that have been so mistreated during the pandemic against each other. That said, if you’ve never taught in a public school, you have no idea how impossible it is to keep yourself and a classroom full of kids from spreading this virus.. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.

Register here: https://on.natgeo.com/3gWJHAj","It’s amazing how poorly understood Science and the scientific method is to the majority of US Citizens.Science is not instant, it’s not perfect and it changes as we learn more. THAT does not mean that there is a conspiracy or that there is ill-intent.We take an oath to “First, Do No Harm”.…See More. Mari Machado yet they claim to be the 'bestest' nation in the world...hypocrisy at its finest.. It's not amazing, it's intentional. Unfortunately, American's are distracted by the clown in office to realize a 6x bankrupted con man, with over 35k lawsuits pending against him for cheating blue collar workers, over 40+ sexual accusations against h…See More. very true Mari. As early as when I was in college, people still respected scientists and admired the highly educated, and WANTED TO BE EDUCATED THEMSELVES. What the f*ck happened? Nowadays people are experts in their own minds after watching a 3 minute YouTube video....and slamming experts with decades of learning and hard work behind them, like Dr Fauci. It's sad, scary, and frustrating.. So Fauci took that oath too? Doesn’t look like it. Had no idea so many science illiterate conservatives followed Nat Geo...🤦♂️🤷♂️. Derek Donnell , herd immunity.  See we believe in real science not the BS you say will work. But keep trying. Robert D Clarkson may I ask what university your degree in virology is from?. Colin Babb 100% a bot. Robert D Clarkson believe? Science is the oposite of beliefs. Follow evidence where they lead and not ignoring them in order to support what you want things to be. There is no beliefs in science, we follow evidences. And you swallow youtube stupidity.. The science illiterate are the ones believing the numbers right out the gate...and it's not the conservative.. Derek Donnell laughing at paralyzed children says a lot about your character. I have been following the bill gates foundation for almost a decade. He has committed crimes against humanity. He deserves to burn in hell for the pain and suffering he has caused. Wake up!. Amy Halligan Let me guess.... Trump U. grad?. I had an inkling. NatGeo comment fields are always... interesting.. Derek Donnell And how many did they innoculate?. Let me guess, you believe men have periods too don't you...yay science. Look at the numbers instead of opinion pieces.. Derek Donnell I was just thinking the same thing. And the views are staggeringly paranoid and illogical.. Amy Halligan, and the League of Stupid Women.. Here you go with trying to link conservatism with illiteracy as well as ability to perceive when the govt is bullshitting you.. Patrick Anwandter what no retort? Yeah that's what I thought - typical cowardice from a gaslighting astroturfing shill. Derek Donnell I actually agree with Alex here since many think Science only happens in school and not in real life, so they refuse to accept what's happening.. Robert D Clarkson 50 to 83% population infection to reach the herd immunity threshold for Covid19.. Derek Donnell They think the follow makes them vicariously knowledgeable and scientific while not even understanding the words I just typed.. Amy Halligan. Derek Donnell says a liberal who believes everything he’s told.. Charley Thomas charley you really don’t know how to think do you. Derek Donnell That's presuming that these comments are by actual human being and not right-mongering bots.. Peter Lasorte  Oh really. That’s the comment you came back with? Okay Karen. You seem to have the erroneous belief that your ridiculous views amount to something. When in fact they are the feeble musing of a halfwit. Actually that’s giving you way too much credit. They musing of a product of a sibling union. Have a splendid day. You are a very disappointing. Bet all the girls tell you that.. They seek out things to make themselves angry.  Self-triggering. Derek Donnell they have no lives. Robert Tegarden he went to TrumpU. Peter Lasorte listen  Karen, have you read the Lancet paper re HCQ or are you focusing on articles that support your confirmation bias?. It seems lately that the scientist and mainstream media have been setting the science bar pretty low. I remember a time when it took time to develop a knowledge base for the science. Now the fad'science changes almost daily.. Pavel San-Martinek well I would hope no independent research on a new virus was done the last few years. And again you cannot cook results the same twice. Outside influences change the results, so peer review would make the result invalid.. Tyson Zufelt i do hope the same. At this point, despite I do not believe conspiracies, don’t know until what point the sides are right or wrong. I guess we will have to wait and see what is next.. Paul Fortier scientific information changes constantly. Love the laugh reactions. Haha, one of the most brilliant scientists in the world who is just trying to do his job. That’s funny.. Yep, Suzi- you fit the bill.. Stay mad about a laugh emoji Emily Eccles😆 Sensitive much honey? 😆😘?Have a fear filled day.😘. Suzi Wheatley is a charming example of what's wrong in America today.. Except he's not though.  Even his own words.. Suzi Wheatley except she isn’t mad. You seem triggered though. Go lick some doorknobs and toilet seats and show us how brave you are.. Suzi Wheatley what gave you the impression she is mad? No angry emojis as opposed to all of your childish emojis which merely show that you can’t even construct a decent sentence, let alone have a grown-up conversation. But really, what’s so funny about a scientist?. Emily Eccles just ignore the morons.. Jadine Sayer and people aren't dying at the rate 'science said humans would' by touching the front of our masks, then touching other stuff that other people who touch the front of their mask go to touch.  If people would really watch what others do you'd never leave your house and have others bring germs to you!. We have learned this guy has changed his mind on every turn. Just like the weather channel they will be more than happy to look out the window to tell you if it's raining.'. Lynette Simonson Knudsen I am not a fan of Impeached Donald trump, but he didn't tell people to drink bleach. He implied bleach kills the virus (which it does).. Lynette Simonson Knudsen Sorry, where did I become a science denier for slating people who don't adapt to evidence?. James R Woodhead science denier much?? Better to drink bleach then?😉. Tyson Zufelt Really. Science the first admission was there was no way mask would work at all. What science would change in order for you to do an about face on that. My year of qualitative and quantitative analysis was not a waste.. Kenny Drasen there’s this thing called Trial and Error. Lesson: Use common sense, believe in science rather in a megalomaniacs daily rantweets. Aditya Narayan , herd immunity.  Look it up. It works. Oh wait you can't spread fear with it like the left wants to do. And I see more hate and fear coming out of the left than the right. So you should actually use reL common sense these days.. Wow this is pointless.. Idiots like Robert D Clarkson haven't read a non fiction book on their own accord their entire life. They get their source of informstion from facebook articles and mainstream news. And then callnother people sheep while he baaaaaaaaaaaaaas all over Facebook. Just ignore them. No point. Johnny Mac sheep. Esca Jensen It's a Coronavirus and like any other of its kind it's not going to disappear nor is there a successful Vaccine due to the constant Mutations. I don't believe that we can hide from a virus at some point everyone will be infected.. Esca Jensen before you continue with your bias, one word... Switzerland.. Esca Jensen Glad you realize it. There's no cure for stupidity.. Wow..... I can't believe the amount of NEGATIVITY?! What is that all about? He is the good guy, who had and has to put up of a goverment that doesn't let him do his job..... Matthias Friedrich , this man doesn't know how to do his actual job. He is a fear mongering mouth piece for the liberal left.. Robert D Clarkson. Robert D Clarkson how is telling people to social distance and wear a mask for public safety “fear mongering” you’re smoking crack. Robert D Clarkson anti intellectualism is not an intelligent look.. Matthias Friedrich Funny! I’ve never heard that before. 🙄 And it ‘s my married name because I not a freak of nature or a pervert.. Neda Suhail saying masks aren't necessary is not a 'context.' Especially from one who is supposedly the expert.. Kevin Miller atta boy, Kev!. Kevin Miller That’s the stupidest comment I have seen. Did you finish school?. Rajesh Singh Did you ever start?. Matthias Friedrich lol... sorry! 😂. We all can’t believe you haven’t caught on to what happening.. ...people were begging Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act so that we could have masks ; so that we could get ventilators and instead of helping out the United States in our time of need, he was telling people -> 'you don't need a mask, the virus is a hoax, go to work'. Thanks, everybody for responding.... I will make sure to never, ever comment on a post in Facebook ever again..... lol. Matthias Friedrich just some pathetic trump groupies having tantrums. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Johnny Mac he graduated from Facebook University. Michael Anthony I think you’re confusing Fauci with Trump 🧐. Hahahahahahahahahaha Fran Tarantella. Johnny Mac yeah ok haha. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans 👏. We've learned not to trust this doctor.. Darrell Spurlock Jr.. Found the sheep who hasn't read a book since highschool. Who touts youtube videos, Facebook posts and memes as his information source. And thinks others are sheep LOL.. Dr. QuackNtrump gave us an economy just above the great depression  and 165,000 dead and models are predicting +200,000 dead by election day.  But somehow morons believe it's the fault of the medical professionals.  This would be hilarious if not for the death and suffering and 20 million unemployed Americans.. Apparently him and the rest of his trumpanzees that get their sources from youtube videos. Harry Thu a “MAGA Yell Loudly” graduate from the University of YouTube is a highly coveted achievement, in some circles!. Robert D Clarkson. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans 👏. Randy Whetstine is he around anyone outside of his bubble? No this isn't him being hypocritical.. Brittany Golden youve said that everytime, is that all you can add to the conversation. Cassandra Mcdaniel think you mean 'without'. Cassandra Mcdaniel some brain you must have trusting Trumps opinion over the guy who is a million times more qualified.. Spreading fear is not something i see as medical , he should learn how to speak before talks to groups and tells us 'The message is DANGER' like a old gospel revival before the Revivalist releases a bag of snakes in the church and demands faith. I like NATGEO , i don't like people that spread fear.. Exactly what 'fear' are you referring to? He's been trying for months, as additional knowledge is gained, to have Americans, all Americans, protect themselves until a viable vaccine is distributed.. Snake Handling is not a good way to convince people in medicine. You mean like trump spreading fear every time he speaks.. He  knocks  HCQ  because  it  works  and  if  people  took  it  they  wouldn’t  need  Remdesivir,  which  he  has  a  stake  in. Lisa Flynn go for it what do you have to lose?, chances are you are asymptotic and it’s just a drug. And then you can tell everyone it saved your life. You sound like you know what’s going on or maybe a stable genius.. https:''www.euronews.com'...'large-global-study-suggests.... Ahhh.. the LA Times!  I feel better now.. Otro corrupto genocida y falso totalmente, sólo busca el y la oms acabar hasta con un 90% a la población, sigan idolatrandolos no la de borregos.. Lisa Flynn then he’s lying. Did he tell you that when you’re on this drug you have to go for what’s called a field vision test every six months to check for macular damage? Did he tell you that it can take up to 2 years for the drug to leave your body completely?. Your reasonable, reliable and accurate source for your statement is.....?. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans 👏. Jadine Sayer I  don’t  need  it.  I  was  asking  in  case  I  did.  The  people  who  took  HCQ  early  had  almost  immediate relief.  One  of  them  was  fighting  two  types  of  cancer,  took  HCQ  on  a  friday Friday and  was  back  to  work  Monday.  If  you  have  faith  in  ventilators and  vaccines then  stick  with  it.  I  sincerely  hope  they  work  for  you.. The problem is the wrong information that we have from the beginning of this pandemic. The arrogance of the president and the loss souls of the scientific community. Just to please the miss information of the politicians. America proud of my country Spain. We are together in this and we are fighting to have a better way of life. With responsibility.. Wait for the introduction people this is a scientist explaining science and it’s not the long-haired dude with the ball hat on he’s just doing the introducing. National Geographic, where are the pictures we love? The indigenous societies we love to discover? The world beauty you show? Who wants a corrupt doctor in a magazine about nature? You suck!!!!!. Give Lisa her pitcher book! 😂🤣😂. Lisa Beth sniff sniff. Typos and auto correct happen. Im I getting graded on this? Lol. Benedikt Kuhn don’t be an asshole please. Lisa Beth in other articles, especially in the actual magazine.. Corrupt doctor......ignorant people....this is why we laugh at you. The good doctor, that would be a great idea for a tv show!. Russia isn't experiencing a second wave.Russia has developed a vaccine.Russia is sharing the vaccine with the  rest of the world.Be like Russia: talk less, act more.. What expertise does Bowser bring to the table re pandemics? NatGeo is disgracing itself by providing platform to partisan hacks and politicos. Sure way to lose readership.. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans 👏. Carlos Daniel Do you know how to read? My comment questions choice of Bowser. Do some research if you don’t know who she is. And stop disgracing yourself by ad hominem attacks.. Rajesh Singh you're the one turning it into a political thing, Fauci never took any political side and never tried to turn any of this into politics. People like you are the problem, he's just trying to do what he did all his life, trying to help people.. That the entire government system is corrupt. Including the doctors hospitals any this man on your picture. Curious on how much stock you own in Moderna? So quick to rule out a Russian vaccine. The history of Moderna is an interesting read. Quite the investment company there. Inside trading, poor history of a drug that actually worked. Poor ethics. And majority back by the central bank.. Todd Murphy he Russian vaccine is rushed and not properly tested, they have not released any information come the first two rounds of testing, so yes he feels that it my not be a good vaccine, as you and everyone should. Because they can hurt you if th…See More. You will learn that your so called experts is the worst blunder in the history!. The very day after the elections, the virus is totally gone........ Ted Giannopoulos just from the US or from all the other countries?. Typical north american, thinks that the whole world spins around the US. derp derp derp derp, derp derp derp........ Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans 👏. Mimi Cronin I don’t know... but I do care for America,. Ted Giannopoulos Exactly. You don't know. But you're more than willing to present your poorly-formed opinion as fact.. ABC and national geographic, is main stream media not experts. How is the mayor of D.C an expert too🤔. All l know is that pandemics are not new. Humanity have witnessed periodic outbreaks of epidemics and pandemics since the dawn of time. Mankind has endured & we have had huge strides in terms of prevention, scientific advancement, sanitation, treatment and vaccination.. Looking forward to it!. Science is about changes and how we should deal with them. So it's not about changing mind but adapting to what is.. We’ve learned that evil politicians are so quick to politicize anything they see fit to try and destroy an opponent no matter how negative it’s effects are on the American people.. That we haven't learned anything.. This is ridiculous. Extinction is the only way to stop pandemics. Every species has them, and will until their all dead. Stop treating medicine like magic. Embrace the population reduction.. Stephanie Sarah ok first the world will not be flooded like 'water world' if all the ice shells melt, second the last one in Canada just fell, not the last one in the world. Third if we stay on earth eventually we would be fucked because the sun will e…See More. Tyson Zufelt the earth is way over populated. We dont have a chance. The last ice shelf just fell. You better buy a boat.. Stephanie Sarah the world is no where near overpopulated what a stupid statement. To most, science is just an opinion. And money can buy opinions.. You lost me with the inclusion of Bowser...........seriously???. Conservatives are going to come out the closet for this one & demonstrate their inability to function on planet earth.. Andres Ruiz , death cult????? Your mind is so warped. Fine wear your mask. I won't. I'll be the one that will see the finish line.. Robert D Clarkson bc wearing a mask is difficult rocket science. Anti-Maskers are in bed with neo Nazis & there is hardly any difference between the two so yeah you are brutally racist redneck scholar.. I wasn't too far off there was I?. Andres Ruiz you must be joking? Masks? Really? I’ve seen hundreds and hundreds of them without masks.. do some research into who funded the wuhan lab. Kellie Dibble. I guess those who posted the haha emoji are know-it-alls or get their info from their cousin who works as assistand hairdresser in East Shrewhampton... Kelly Sweeney I hearted her comment and everything lmao. Shakeela Ameera I am not sure I understand but whether we like it or not science is science. We like it when the doctors save our lives don't we? We like it when science makes our lives comfortable. But we do not like it when it urges us to be responsible citizens.. Love the doctor death picture, its a classic. 💀. Why are we afraid of a virus that’s less deadly than the flu?. Natgeo not classy now, you sold your soul?. Russia Vaccine isn't going to work for Fauci either..   He has nothing invested in that group.... The last RNA vaccine we tried killed so many people we stopped trying.. I bet he's not first in line for it.... Great! A former CEO of Moderna and one of the funders was Epstein. NatGeo is losing the plot. Piss off Disney. The funder of Epstein https:''www.youtube.com'watch?v=5K7sa7EeUGc. Don't pay attention to all the negativity in this feed... haters will always hate... especially the willfully ignorant crowd.  #FactsOrFO. Thulitha Abayawardana oh how brilliant and witty you are. Piss off. Ha ha (bloody) ha... and my name is Debbie (Debz if you're nasty). Fran Tarantella don't misuse the term 'Karen'. Just look in the mirror.. Fauci = Deep State 👎🏻. Davy Van de Voorde  You don’t mean the Lizard People?. Robert Walling this man predicted a global pandemic, read the coronavirus, under Trumps presidency.  Hmmm he could indeed be a lizard. Evidently not a damn thing and he's been head medical honcho for how many years????. One only has to read the esseys on virus Fauci has put out eariler in his career and relaize he is full of it !. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans 👏. Tina Khin I see you work for NIH, i know people who do also, you spend millions on research and collect government paychecks and produce nothing, been researching the drug problem since 1960 and still have not come up with anything !. John Gabriszeski “the drug problem” lmao.. Criminal mind. We’ve heard enough from this joker.. Aww so many high school dropouts here 😂. U should invite a better person, not that solded onde.. I knew Fauchi was a snake the first time I saw him on TV.. More Bs. What’s the margin of error on carbon 14 dating?. It seems the Democrats are the ones that say there are 26 genders.. Fauci can't even count to 10...what a sellout POS who will rot in hell for the millions of lives he destroyed..

109,So.. gyms are opened back up... malls... grocery stores... parks... lakes... trails... restaurants... bars...yet movie theaters havent been opened back up yet??? Youd think it would be much easier to control the amount of people per theater room... I just want movie theaters to open back up already! 😭😭😭,"I can see movie theaters being opened but the seats would be hard to disinfect. The issue is the duration. People are sitting in the same spot in a movie theater with questionable ventilation for much much longer than any other activity you listed.. I think this was somewhat of a choice and not many movies.  I heard they were going to open up but old movies. Also, I think drive-ins should be a thing again!!. Melissa Eide Hammerstrom I mean there’s a lot of parks that do movies throughout the summer. Taylor, I've heard of a few places... I think there should be more, and have them not go away. I think it's such a fun outing for families. Melissa Eide Hammerstrom Marymoor park is showing The Princess Bride Monday the 17th at 8:15 PM. AMC did announce 100 theaters opening. AMC opens the 20th. Wearing masks i mess eating or drinking. Limiting seating. Cassie Crane Braegger I'm with your husband lol. I love  AMC Wednesday where its half off... BIG FAN... I've felt so lost with out my movie nights! Its was my 'me day'. I'm stoked 🤣🤣🤣. And that buttery popcorn and coca cola freezes!!! Lol. Maralyn Akiyama oh really?  Dang why send the damn e mail and get my hopes up. Cassie Crane Braegger i know. If you have the AMC app. The email says they will 'start to open'. Click on 'find your state' ... Washington says 'will reopen when local guidelines allow'. Let's hope we can keep our virus numbers down so we can reopen before daylight savings time ends!.

If they do not serve food then they are closed. You have to be able to order chips or a sandwich or something.. I WANT POPCORN DAMNIT. Hope Fox mmmeeee tooooo.....

Because the DOJ failed their suit against Harvard, they're going after Yale.  Obviously, they want the issue before the Supreme Court.  Pathetic.. So the students who made the cut dont care about others who didnt make the cut, solely because they were discriminated against.. Yup.  Gee, a Yale student does not want to say publicly that the school discriminates.  Meanwhile, Yale & Harvard run quotas. not how it works-they think that they are better not luckier -but they are a number of individuals I guess each feels/thinks about this differently. Not all cultures put an equal emphasis on education. Therein lies the problem, possibly.... Just drag the proceedings out to January and then Poof! they will disappear along with Barr.. I really want to have this conversation, starting with legacy admissions.. Yale had better prepare to write a yuuuge settlement check. The administration unlawfully discriminated against Asians and Whites!. Stands to reason that the Barr “Justice Department” which saw nothing wrong with dismissing charges against Flynn would want to cause division wherever it can.. The FBI's own memo's show that Flynn never 'lied', and now it is also known that the FBI threatened to go after members of Flynn's family on bogus charges if he didn't plead 'guilty.' It's called 'prosecutorial misconduct' ---and the charges against Flynn needed to be dropped for the sake of justice.. Michael Froebe don’t you mean biggley rather than big-huge. Let me guess you believe in QAnon and pizzagate.. you have the right to believe what ever-but as the prosecutors majorly did wrong-even had he been convicted he would walk-Brady rule is like big-hugeIn that case, the Supreme Court established a rule that prosecutors must disclose “Brady material” to the defense. The failure to disclose such material is a “Brady violation,” a violation of the U.S. Constitution.. Mexican American students are not rushing to Yale University.

Where are you getting that info?. Diane It isn’t. This person is trolling and/or spreading misinformation.. Cari Page actually , you are wrong . I hear it first hand from nurses and doctors .. Natallia Fairchild Cari Page is a nurse. And when a person dies there is more than 1 space on the death certificate so yes they could die from complications of Covid.. Jackie Roemish we would have exponentially more deaths if that was the case 🙄. Jackie Roemish there are roughly (very rough estimate) 7,000 deaths per day in the US from various causes. Today is day 227 of the year meaning there have been about 1.5 million deaths in the US from any cause. If all deaths are considered covid related then why isn't the death toll for Covid in the US 1.5 million?. Shelly Marie Dollar Witt it wasnt on this thread but I believe it's on this post-  a woman named tonya share a pic of someone with leg issues and then it says covid related- that's a bit alarming you would think if a death had absolutely nothing to do with covid, then they wouldn't put covid, but I guess not. 🤷♀️.

174,"Just six months ago, Biden's campaign seemed all but over. Now, he has an 11-point lead over the incumbent president, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Here's how he got to this point:","Pretty straightforward, few were excited for him, same with most of the other candidates, because the democratic party is struggling to stay relevant and their only real strength is in rallying against a disastrous Trump presidency. Still voting for him and kamala though.. We cannot become complacent!  Remember to vote.. Vote shaming wont change a persons mind. Its 100% reasonable for someone who would NEVER vote for Trump or Biden to vote third party or write in. Thats how it works.. Mario Simmons I'd love to return to the legislation that was in place before trump steamrolled it all back with acting directors.. Scott Yep it will be really sad if the Dems lose to him again, to bad they dont want progressive allies.. Mario Simmons you haven’t been paying attention then. Democrats are pushing for Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, student debt relief, mail in voting during a pandemic, among other initiatives. That is not “we aren’t trump”, that is a lot of policies that would help the common person in America, not just the 1% and corporations like the Republicans are pushing.. Sue Greenhause no, still very much favor making money for insurances.. Stacie Hall but they aren’t in court trying to dismantle the affordable care act either. Zane Smith I guess you are fine with Trump staying in power.  Hope the rest of Bernie’s supporters are smarter than that.. It's more than filling out your ballot. It's making sure it gets to the elections office. I'm delivering mine in person. Early. And then checking to make sure it gets counted.. Oh, I will...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zEkR-D6TnQ. Mario Simmons when asked what he wanted to accomplish in his second term... trump drew a blank. Zane Smith then you’re voting for tRump.  Nice work!🤨. Zane Smith I’m not a fan of splitting the vote. I too would prefer a much more progressive candidate (Warren would be my choice), but by writing in, you’re giving trump a tiny advantage. I am more against giving trump any advantage than I am for any candidate running against him.. Benjen Sanchez yes, yes, yes!. Benjen Sanchez for Howie Hawkins 👍. Mario Simmons Not gonna argue that there aren't issues with the current lineup, but ;Not Trump' means A LOT. Not Trump means free and fair elections, it means a government and its institutions not being systematically dismantled, it means a stop to the…See More. Mario Simmons If your definition of “reasonable “ includes wasting your vote.  If you want a strong independent party you need to start working diligently six or eight years out, developing candidates, getting them elected, and raising sums of money equivalent to the two major parties. Otherwise a vote for an independent is both naive and an exercise in futility.. Vote Blue, join the cavalry!. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing as in 2016 and expecting different results. Take charge of the moment and fight rather than preaching togetherness. You can’t bring a divided nation together by losing an election.. Marc JBraunstein , Google: who won the popular vote in 2016, Dingus....The people lost because of some dated rules. It's not going to happen this time around I assure you.. Ric Otero But the electoral college still exists, so the same exact thing is likely to happen again. The democrats need to understand this is an uphill battle in the swing states. I drove by about 3 times more Trump signs than Biden on my way to the st…See More. Józef Joestar II It's interesting listening to early episodes of Pod Save America, a podcast commentary from Obama admin guys, from early 2017. They insist the DNC lost for very specific reasons and they can't use those same tactics or they will suffer the same fate in 2020. All of their reflection has gone to waste.... Ric OteroTo be fair: those dated rules you mentioned haven't actually gone anywhere. Going for a moderate candidate may not have been the best move here. We won't win over any Trump supporters no matter how much we try to compromise with them.. Valerie, sad but true.  Biden offers nothing but 'not Trump.'. Excuse me, but the GOP is running on the exact same platform they used in 2016. Trump is recycling his smear tactic of questioning a candidate's eligibility because of their citizenship. He's still crying 'But her emails!'  He's living in the past with no new plans for the next four years. No one is interested in reruns of his bad four year reality show.. Jason Seow That’s not entirely true though. Some have figured it out and are not voting for him again. Follow @Trump_Regrets on twitter. It gives me a little bit of hope.. Ric Otero google “how to win a presidential election in the United States”.. Marc JBraunstein , togetherness is a huge word. It's simple in structure but, so very complicated in action.. Marc JBraunstein this ain't 2016. POLLS SHMOLES. I will only do my vote. Polls mean zip in this election war. There is too much postal chaos trump is initiating.. Shirley Fenile yeah since the last election, you can’t trust polls. Just yourself and to encourage every non-voter to register to vote!. Shirley Fenile This is going to sound nuts.   Drive or walk to a polling place, bring ID, wait in line, then vote.. David Rout I have mail in 30 yrs. No thx.. I am not sure a pbs/npr poll is a true representation of the American people.  I want Biden to win but I'm not gonna be blindsided like I was last election.  No complacency. Vote.. Oh, he does know the difference,  just prefers to go along with rhe one who speaks what he thinks.. Agree with you on the need to avoid complacency, BUT please study up a little on how polling works. Reputable organizations *sponsor* polls, but don't have anything to do with how they're conducted. NPR/PBS hired experts to do the actual poll. There ar…See More. Don't want to sound like a broken record, but in 2016 all it took was a few 10,000s people in swing states to go 'meh, I'll vote 3rd party or write in to show 'em.' Please, for the sake of the world and the human race we cant afford tantrums like that.. Kelvin Ng well maybe ur party should stop putting forward trash candidates. Ross Caudill just keep laugh reacting my comments bc you have nothing valid to say. We see right through your laugh reacts.. Frank Baker Dempsey trash candidates? Let’s talk about Trump. I’m down for more party recognition and support, but not this election....a ramp up in 3rd Party or Independent support this election is a guaranteed win for Trump.  One goal....get Trump out of the White House, and then let 2024 be a free for all election.. Nick Cavaioli There's no need for or else, because we are already there.. Your right Trump 2020. Kelvin Ng it took a lot more people voting for a DC outsider con man because the Dem choice didnt campaign hard in swing states.. Millie Cox That is false. It will be a vote for whom ever I voted for. Hilary lost because she insulted Democrats and didn’t try to win them over after the primary. She didn’t inspire people. I voted for her because she wasn’t Trump, but I didn’t want …See More. Kelvin Ng truth, brother. Truth.. Billy Flynn in prison!. Biden is a republican with dementia.. That's why Trump hired kanye with tax payers money. Piss. Off. We have the right NOT to vote for trash candidates. Neither of these candidates represent what I want. 3rd party candidates should be allowed on the debate stages. The Left says a 3rd party vote takes a vote away from Biden; the Right says it takes away a vote from Trump. I'm not going to hold my nose and vote for someone.. Jamison Normand nope vote blue-Biden or you have voted for Trump. Ross Caudill screw you & your petty tantrum. Kelvin Ng and my fear is that's exactly what inexperienced, fed-up, newbie under-20's voters will do by voting for Kanye.. Kelvin Ng - Agreed. In 2016 Clinton had a 10 point lead; look what happened.. Kelvin Ng “vote for my party or else” isn’t democracy, bro. I don't recall that Biden's campaign seemed 'all but over' 6 months ago.  It is just so important that he is elected...we must continue to support him and work to get everyone out to vote for him.. If he loses its his own fault and the Democratic party's fault. His record is horrible. Im sure 100+ million people will not vote for the presidency. Lois Widener Alworth don't be a libtard.  biden will lose.  Or do you want your grandchildren to suffer the same fate as Cannon in a democrapic run country with criminals running rampant and the police non-existent?. Lois Widener Alworth Right. Biden was the top candidate before he even announced he was running.. It’s wasn’t long and rocky lol. The dnc establishment paved his way for drug him along. It’s fine. Better than trump.. Adam Campbell you’re right about the first part. The second part is up for debate. It's very motivational, inspirational, and a lesson for our kids to never give up. That even if you are politician who has spent nearly 50 years in Washington DC and has written legislation that protects big banks over ordinary citizens and crime bills that cause an explosion of incarceration rates for non violent offenses, you are never too old or too senile to become President.. James Sohr - grow up!  If you are for Trump vote for him.  Stop with the obfuscation of your intent will irrelevant comparisons.. Damon Fehler Ah, yes. If you believe that there were other candidates who were far more qualified than Joe Biden you must be a Donald Trump supporter.'If you don't vote for Joe Biden, you ain't a Progressive'. Clarence Walker You’re right. He should be blaming Mitch McConnell, since he’s sitting on over 400 bills passed by the House. Also, McConnell is responsible for not removing Trump from office during impeachment. Mitt Romney is the ONLY Republican with a shred of real decency and patriotism.. James Sohr he’s been in office for over 50 years? And he blames trump cause nothing gets done? What’s wrong with that picture. Grace Colf they both are, that’s the joke.. You too can be a pedophile and run for president of the USA (or even be the president!). Jack S Wolfie , trump did that!. He got there by mainstream democrats, not on his own platform. There is nothing inspirational about him.. There is plenty for me. He is not a crazy fascist. That is very important.. Zach Tiemann. Zach Tiemann “not Trump” is enough for me right now.. At this point any Democrat candidate would have had at least a 11 point lead.. Dave Koltes You can hope, but Joe has been... uniquely steady and reassuring here. He's a known, decent quantity. That might not be the case with other Dems who are more easily demonized.. He’s a horrible pick for the Dems.  So many more qualified  people out there than this lifetime, career politician.  I’m embarrassed for the Democratic Party.. Casie McCall Clayton How's he fighting? All he does in whine about how no one likes him and how unfair everything is to him. Trump is a weak joke that has weakened America.. Kim Nickells , he renamed the PRU and moved it to another department.  He was called names for starting the travel ban!  It’s a pandemic, caused by China.. Casie McCall Clayton I think both parties are actively trying to lower the bar. The next round will have a better candidate than the incumbent for the next few generations.. Wayne Wilkinson - did you think of that all by yourself?  Good job!. Casie McCall Clayton you sound ridiculous too.. Casie McCall Clayton yeah he's a businessman all right. Did you remember how he managed to bankrupt his casinos and frauded students at his university? Or the numerous reports of how he underpaid or didn't pay his workers?He's a businessman all right. Doesn't mean he's a good one, or a good president..

Still ignoring the fact he is in severe cognitive decline?. David Rout Yeah. Plenty to blame on both sides historically and present. Many mistakes.. Yong Park .. Oh lord.. NPR has really sheltered you from reality my friend.. Yong Park Senate blocked Os picks.. David Helms no worse than Trump and more than likely far better relatively speaking.. David Helms yes they are.. That about balances out the Trumpublican/Putin voter obstruction, manipulation, fraud, obfuscation and divisive propaganda campaigns aimed ay Illigitemately stealing another election.  Vote like your life depends on it.  Joe is an honorable compassionate leader who will do his level best to steer the ship of state out of rocky waters.. That’s because President Obama talked every moderate that was beating him to drop out of the race. The fact that he only has an 11 point lead over Trump perfectly illustrates his ineptitude.. I don’t even want to know what the poll results are. 538 had Clinton winning by a huge margin right up until election night!. David Leblond That isn't true. 538 consistently warned in the weeks before the election that other media outlets were overestimating Clinton's chances, that the race was tighter than people thought, and that Trump had an electoral college advantage. They had Trump's odds of winning at three in ten which isn't exactly a rare thing.. Yup. 538 had Clinton up by 3.6 percent, and the actual margin was 2.1 percent -- well within all margins of error. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/. Paul Murray exactly it’s so tiresome this willful ignorance to misunderstand what polls are and mean. It also helps that he hasn’t had an unscripted interview since 2018.. aww look I hurt its feelings. JD Backberg 11/2017. Kevin Howlett https://youtu.be/JtvGR8UX1L0. And Trump's off script endless video, phone a fox & friend and tweets are proving he needs a padded room. Knock it off! We can see the difference.. David Rout The one who is cheating, again, is worse.. Biden's campaign lacks the energy.  Still hoping he'll win just because he's not Trump, the corrupt, con man who's just looking out for himself.. And if Biden loses they will once again blame everyone BUT themselves for nominating an awful candidate.  The only reason Biden has any chance at all in the general election is Trump.  Imagine how big a lead the Democrats would have if they hadn’t nominated a “transitional president”.. Alex Gross I'm not a Biden fan, and would vote for a decent Republican over Biden....but I will NEVER give trump my vote... so, Biden it is!! As trump would say... 'what do I have to lose ?' We made it through 4 years of trump... we will survive 4 years of Biden!. Linda Deka My exact same thoughts and feelings!!!. I'll never believe polls again.  Many Trump supporters are too embarrassed to admit they are voting for him.  Vote like you're up against a wannabe dictator who is willing to cheat, cause we are.. Stephanie Striegel The shy or embarrassed Trump voter that doesn't show up in polls is a myth.. Hardy Trenda LaLa right. No one supporting Trump at this point is going to change their mind, but maybe there's enough undecided voters to make a difference.. Paul Murray it’s hard to imagine any Trump supporter staying silent.. Paul Murray glad to hear it.. Stephanie Striegel agreed!. You're right. Some people don't like trump but are still going to vote for him and they're keep their opinions to themselves. My question is, if you are too embarrassed to openly vote for someone, then why in the heck are you voting for them??. Sue Greenhause Thank you!!!. Vote for your favorite pedophile.  Doesn't matter if it's blue or red you will vote for a pedophile slaves.. Gail Cain me too...every day!  This is definitely the election of our lifetime!. Hardy Trenda LaLa it's funny because he hates everyone, but loves manipulating people to make them think he's our their side.. Stephanie Striegel I agree with you about not trusting polls, but I think it’s more likely people who voted for Trump before are more likely not to want to admit that and are are either voting for Biden, not voting for president at all, or writing someone in..

This is funny. NPR/PBS does the poll? That’s not even close to being a non-partisan poll. Why not get the DNC to do the poll?. Tex Gill It's a Marsists poll which is a well respected independent polling company. You'd know that if you did even a smidge of research before commenting.. They're not just calling the people who send them money.  And actually PBS and NPR are not biased.. Clearly you don't understand how polling works. Look into it; it's interesting. Take an introductory measurement and statistics course. For senior citizens like you, they're usually free to audit at a state university or community college, and you don't have to meet the admissions requirements.. Paul Murray Besides Gallup is busy with a new girlfriend.Marist works harder and hasn’t had a date since 97’.. Rocky? He was handed the nomination.. LeaAndrea Johnson yes, handed as in won by several million votes. LeaAndrea Johnson the fix was in. The DNC did it last go round to Bernie too.. The voters picked Biden over Bernie; the ones who dropped out would have only diluted both their numbers and prolonged the primary. It was a smart tactical move, and tactical thinking is what we expect of political parties intent on winning elections.. Troy Carpenter So, it was the voters that dropped out and endorsed him a day or so before Super Tuesday?. Troy Carpenter so you agree, the party 'tactically' rigged the election 😁. Rocky road? As in ice cream, maybe. They handed him the nomination, despite several debate appearances that left most of us wondering why. A desperate move to stop the progressives. Perhaps they were right. Perhaps Biden will do better against Trump than Sanders would have done. But rocky road? Hardly.. Obama convinced the other candidates who were leading Biden to drop out to stop U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Ryan Cab exactly 👌. NPR reporters getting paid for full articles when the story is one sentence long. Ryan Cab are we reading the same thing? I think the title is referring to looking for Obama’s endorsement. I don’t see anything that Obama pressured candidates to drop out. Am I missing something here?.

Antenor Martin Aleman Ramirez are you saying that Bernie did not pull out of his own choice?. No time to be complacent. There are those debates and the issue of turnout. It is a long time yet and the dangerous part for Biden begins now.. Do not become complacent!  We need every single vote.  We need a Blue Tsunami to let the criminals know they're through.. Biden and the DNC don't. Wayne Wilkinson Your profile indicates that you drink a lot.  That probably explains it.. The DNC screwed Bernie Sanders (again) and handed the nomination to the much inferior candidate Biden.. Everyone else dropped out the night before Super Tuesday - not a very long story 🙄. Kailee Bringedahl Great choreography. Nothing is the same about 2016 bro. Bro please! It's a different election! Hillary wasn't polling as well back then, bro. You gotta vote blue no matter who, bro... please. The Democratic establishment isn't flagrantly ignoring and diminishing the voices of the left and youth once again. It's a different election!

Andy Buck do you demonstrate idiocy every day or only when you don’t read an article. This is a cargo ship and the company that manages it is doing the cleanup. Perhaps read an article before you demonstrate bigotry and ignorance in the same comment.. Japan is still leaking nuclear waste if I’m not mistaken.  They continue to wreak havoc Globally..... Breaking: American complains about Japan’s use of nuclear technology. Lol @ reek. Erik Weston it wasn't the Japanese that made Hiroshima or Nagasaki radioactive.... It’s not being collected and stored like the stuff at Hanford which leaks a tiny bit as storage tanks degrade. Raquel Leiva Fukushima didn’t happen??. Raquel Leiva actually it kind of depends on how you look at it- if Japan hadn’t killed millions of people and tried to take over half of the world- Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not have been bombed.. Ok yeah Japan is slacking, wtf?. Greg Diebold your fundamental lack of historical understanding is a bit disturbing and completely off topic.. Who owns it? I feel like there’s been a deliberate move away from identifying the owners. Have they even said who actually owns the oil and the ship? Who’s responsible for cleaning up this oil?. human beings are the worst thing to ever happen to the planet.  the sooner we go extinct the better. There's just no learning when it comes to oil transport.  It's the definition of insanity.. Georgia Willis  that literally is not the definition of insanity.

David McLeod a ship snapping in half is not an accident, it is negligence.... David McLeod rather than resorting to insults, would you explain why it was not a forseeable accident? They choose a poor route through a highly sensitive area they shouldn’t have been in to begin with.. 'Worst ecological disaster in the country's history' is misleading, since Mauritius has only been a country since 1968. The ship sinkings in the region during the Second World War dwarf this accident by orders of magnitude.. 'Worst ecological disaster' slipped right past you. War is not a 'ecological disaster' . Ralph, oh man, this is what got you all worked up??Priorities buddy.. Nah, it's a slow news day, Tim 😃 At least I'm not arguing that an ecological disaster is a disaster caused by the environment, or whatever that fool was trying to prove 😃. Ronald Auther he’s talking about all the oil going down with this ships.. Nothing outlasts the destruction of 2020. It keeps going and going and going.... Whoa. Exxon-like malfeasance again. The Valdez spill in Alaska. This is another long enduring horror.. Sacilliyah Yves Walker not even remotely, it was a cargo ship that ran into a reef, not an easily foreseeable or preventable thing.. We all know that fossil fuel is bad but who really cares as long as it run our car and everything we need. Tomorrow we will ship more and more. They weren’t shipping it as you say, they were using it as fuel, which is currently the only option for moving cargo ships unless you prefer nuclear power. Even then they will have tons of oil-based lubricants and such on board.. David McLeod its a Fuel oil right?. Japan should clean it up ASAP. Such a nuisance leaving it like that!!. Mauritius, for those not keeping track of extinctions, was the home of the Dodo bird. It no longer is, because the Dutch just killed them all after they got there..

Fabrizio Montanar money and convenience. Because no one has locked down the country of origin registration and Panama and Liberia make it so easy.         If it were more difficult,  the cruise ships would actually operate out of their home country and be responsible for their actions.   It's only the environmental disasters that have us question the shipping industry.. We have got to stop using fossil fuel.  Enough of big oil oligarchies.. Joe Morrow the only other option for moving large cargo ships is nuclear if you’re fine with that.. *Brought to you by Samsung Galaxy. An item that is made up of minerals and fossil fuels.

Stop electing this kind of world killer please, we all suffer through the planet because of Americans inconsequent votes.. It's intensely hot across Northern California and we had a 2 hour long episode of high winds and dry lightning last night. Really does not bode well for preventing wildfires. There are several burning nearby our area now.. Emily Szasz I’m in Petaluma, north of SF, and we got tons of rain with our lightening that lasted from about 4:30-8AM ... grateful for the rain 💗. Emily Szasz ooh too bad to hear that. Horrible, really. The moment I read about the Heatwave, my concerns immediately were for the possibility of wildfires. And this does not bode well.

It happened since 4:00 am until 11:00 am, the sound was terrible and some places has been affected.. Mili Trujillo-Principe what happened. So sad for Northern California.  here in Southern CA we are having fires, but these Fire Tornadoes are another level of danger. They had them in the Carr fire 2 years ago. Please keep them in your thoughts!. I remember hearing about them then.  Fires bi enough and intense enough to create their own weather systems.  So incredibly frightening!. We had them during Tubbs, too. While evacuating and I could barely stand up with the wind force. Cars flpped over.  It was like the world was ending.. Big love and strong safe vibes!

We have been made a house divided by conspiracy theories, namecalling, fear and veiled threats.. How many decades on the taxpayers' dime with little accomplishment, add in the accusations by Tara Reade which fell off the radar despite reassurances that 'all women should be believed' along with rapidly declining faculties...love him, don't vote for him. He's dedicated his life to public service and helping the common person. He has empathy and compassion for us. He cares about us. I am happy to vote for him and Kamala.. He is a decent, compassionate human being. He is intelligent enough to place the appropriate people in the right positions.

I felt betrayed and believed that I was a laughingstock in my community because people spoke about his cheating on the streets. I lost trust in him. I became easily irritated and resented him. I sometimes woke up at 3 am and started swearing at him. Then towards August last year 2019, after long searching for a solution to my problems, I came across Dr.pablo 0633367262 Facebook comment. The doc invited me to the Altar, and we made prayer because I did not want to lose my husband, but I also wanted him to stay faithful to me. In my desperation to save my marriage, I told my husband about Dr.pablo +27633367262 and invited him to join us in the prayers which he did without hesitation. At the end of the prayer, we spoke to the doc who told us about the Therapy of Love services. We continued to attend to the services on Fridays and understood that we needed God in our marriage and it was all made possible with Dr.pablo's prayers.

495,"A nursing home has pampered their oldest resident on her 107th birthday after strict coronavirus restrictions meant her relatives were barred from the celebration. Great grandmother Betty Spears was unable to mark the occasion with her treasured family and son-in-law Kevin, because of tight restrictions protecting residents at the home. St Judes Nursing Home, in Sutton, Surrey, proudly claims to be one of the only virus-free care homes in the area. Despite this, the team were determined to recognize Betty’s big day, and pay tribute to your joyous character and young spirit. Nurses pampered Betty, herself a former nurse, with beauty treatments and decorated the home in her honor before holding a special 107th birthday party full of singing and laughter.","Happy Birthday! Wish your family was with you, maybe next year and more after that!God bless you, young lady.Thank you to the staff that gave her this special day.. Seniors and elderly in homes and ALF should be allow to see thier families with precautions They are deteriorating quickly and passing away from the loneliness.. What a shame. Surely the family could've worn relevant ppe so to share even an hour with her...Hope she had a fab day though. Happy birthday Betty.x. Cruelty in the name of Covid. First of all her family is more important to her thsn a birthday party. Dhe had over 100 of them. Now too family members could be tested for the virus so you took the easy way out and forsaken her own familyWhat is it about Covid that has made prople lose their minds or are on power trips.. If that many workers can be there, celebrating, her family could have been there instead!!!. Happy Birthday Betty Spears !To all the people who commented, she lives in England.. I live in a beautiful assisted living facility, but have been in quarantine since March 20...although I did play hooky for 4 days in July. After that, I was quarantined in my apartment for 2 weeks...meanwhile, all residents were quarantined and asked n…See More. Happy birthday but if all those employees could have brought in covid-19 then they should have allowed your family. I think she should have been able to spend what could be her last birthday with her family and friends. Happy birthday Betty.. Betty’s family should have been able to see her and celebrate Betty’s Birthday together!. Treasured family and son-in-law Kevin... So, Kevin's not treasured? 🥺😂😜. Happy birthday, Betty. I'm truly ashamed at the sick people on this post that would turn this post into a foul mean spirited political bashing. Grow up and grow some manners.. Her son in law was there, she did see him, if her children are still alive they'd be in their 80's most likely, so at risk also. Fox just twisted the story to poke you all. https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/.../18630207.sutton.../It was nearly a fortnight ago anyway.. Bless her heart! But if the nursing staff can be there the family should be there. Not all the staff needed to there. I think it’s shameful she should have been surround by loved ones not staff.. This plandemic is killing seniors in these care facilities. No social interaction is the worst for them. This is nothing but an overblown flu. These seniors are suffering mentally now. Six months in to this plandemic and we just sent one out because of…See More. This is so sad and wrong.  All those people there in close proximity and they would not allow her family in.  Workers are bringing it in to nursing home residents all over the country, it’s not like they are leaving to get it themselves.. She's 107, for God's sake, make a safe room for her family to visit, even a tent outside. That's just cruel.. This is news but shooting of a 5 year old in the head wasn't. You guys need some priorities.. A nursing home patient being barred from seeing her relatives sounds a lot like illegal false imprisonment to me. No reason this woman can't see her relatives.. Happy Birthday to Betty Spears !! My mother was a Spears ...great name !!. Should have been able to spend it with family masked and distanced even thru a window or outside.Just my opinion.. Happy birthday!!When I end up in a nursing home my kids have strict orders to brake me out if we ever get locked down. I would rather die with my loved ones that live the few years I would have left, apart from them.. This is sickening! This BS has to stop. Wtf??? These workers have been the reason covid has killed the elderly in the past. This is about liability insurance  and money, NOT protecting grandma. People need to rise up.. This makes me so sad 😞 family should be able to see them, if all I need to do to go to work is have my temp checked and a mask, the same should go with families!. Family should have been invited or outdoors so could have came 6 ft distance.. Nursing homes turned out to be death cells because of their lack of considerations towards health safety measures. Sorry but the elderly were better off in empty vegas hotels. Should take her out and move her into their own home. This isn’t right. Probably don’t want to care for her.. Happy birthday Great grandmother Betty Spears.. Happy Birthday! Hoping your day was filled with joy!. The saliva tests now being used at University of Illinois Urbana get results within 5 hrs. Imagine what a difference this would make for all nursing homes. Hope SOMEONE is paying attention.. It seems like overkill to deny her a visit on this very special birthday!!Why can't they let them wear protective covering life me nurses wear and of course a mask??!!Who knows if she'll be around until you allow visitors!!. Beautiful Betty. May you have a blessed birthday.. Wouldn’t want to be that old.  Everyone you would have known would be dead.. But I thought masks worked?? I guess another lie perpetrated by the liberals. 😑. So wrong not to have family there!. Her family should have been there.. Did someone say nursing home. Her loved ones should be around!. For your birthday my face is yours to sit on l. Why didn't they have them visit her outside of the window behind her?. Hey Fox News. What’s wrong now that you don’t allow any photos in the comments section. Are you joining all the other propaganda news stations not wanting truth out to the public?. America: IT'S JUST A FLU. Happy 107th Birthday Betty! I am so very sorry that you are still being forbidden from being with your family.. Why couldn't her family wear masks also?. Why are old age homes? Shame. She's going to die without seeing her family. What is there to celebrate? Live and die without seeing her family? Or live and die seeing her family.....?. Man its so happy to hear good news like this.. Do the workers live in covid-free bubbles outside of work? No!!! Ms. Betty’s family should have been there.. So the workers who go home to their families. The workers who you don’t know who they are in contact with outside of the facility. The workers. Strangers got to celebrate this women’s life and her family could not.  This is unbelievable crap😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡.

People throwing rocks would get the right back.. Tina Davis a LOT of restraint, definitely. Thankless job. Lori McArthur Brewer. carrying out trumps race war!. Lori McArthur Brewer pretty sure beating up civilians is a clear indication they don’t have ANY restraint. This needs to stop now! We need our police. We can rid our police departments of the few bad cops. What we don’t need EVER are rioters and looters!. Patrice Davis Hoover time cull them. Shut up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1JZKZWSCu8. Patrice Davis Hoover not a few bad cops... let's start @ 50% bad 50% ok, let's start there and we can talk. These portland police officers are some of the toughest, most courageous people that I have ever seen. Theopolis comes to mind.. Like I’ve said time & time again.....the city let the police down by making the federal agents leave.  If they would’ve let them stay & take out the trash aka protesters, the police could do their regular job.  Unfortunately, the innocent people are being overlooked because of the incompetence of the city council!  Come on Oregonians WAKE UP!. The entire city should get together and sue the people that are letting this happen. That’s awesome and they still keep letting it happen. The stupidity of the left and liberals is through the roof and they will just keep voting them in. It will never get better until the “right” gets involved. If they voted them they are getting what they deserve the Darwin effect is taking place.. If they ever loved that city, they need to re-elect the guy to start knocking some heads!  Right now his hands are tied.  At this point, I’m sure they find issue with the brand of toothpaste he uses!!!!  🤦‍♀️. Is this even a surprise? The residents of Portland deserve better than this. Those who voted in (and continue to support) the derelict mayor/officials of the city should realize you can’t have it both ways. You want to defund the police? Yet still call them the moment you realize you’ve got no one else? Sickening. Way to go! Elected Officials are a Disgrace. Vote Red or this will be in every single city in the US. God Bless and Protect those who serve.🇺🇸. I live 2 hours south of Portland. Our govenor is useless and doesn't care. However, the rest of us have to make sure we have our masks on or face a $1,000 fine. Oregon is one of the worst places to live in the country. High taxes, high unemployment, terrible school system, housing costs are ridiculous, etc. etc. etc.. Hopefully Oregon will be waking up from this, and realize that voting blue has been destroying them. They will turn into a red state.. And yet the marxist leaders of this failed city claim that Federal officers were the problem. And what happened when they left? These rioters barricade a police building with people inside and tried to burn them alive. This isn't protesting, its viol…See More. This is why we MUST have gun rights👊 Defensive measures are necessary, when the government you pay to protect you messes up their one job.... LMAO. People of Portland get what they tolerate. Feel free to recall your mayor and the rest of the city council. The ones in control aren't doing chit for law abiding citizens.. Hmmm....  Looks like Oregon has a real handle on serving the people who contact 911.  Nice going, Oregon.  I hope your residents remember you at the ballot box...  Karma..... They voted their local government in and now they need to pay the price.  Let’s see what happens in the next one.  No sympathies here.. The taxpayers in Portland deserve better if they really do need to quit voting Democrat. One of my friends used to call Oregon, God's Country. Well the devil has wrecked that.. Pride the citizens of this city will wise up and vote Republican. Can't have it both ways. Sorry for those that didn't want any of this. Get out and vote in Nov.. Portland has done this to itself. Decisions are not without consequences.. My heart goes out to the people of Portland put at risk by these protestors.  I hope that vote the crap out of that city.. Keep voting blue and your whole life will be unheeded 🤷🏻‍♂️. Giving them no support, take away their defense and cut the budget what exactly did you expect to happen !. It must suck to live there , and I live in Chicago , so I feel and understand the pain of all this none sense 🤦🏻‍♀️. If any 911 call that couldn't be handled ends up with severe consequences, any one charged with rioting during that time should be charged with some degree of hindering aid.. Aren’t we defunding the police? What’s the problem? 🤷‍♀️. Actions have consequences...voting for democrats for example.. all police should take a month of and leave the rioters to it.city council should respond with their social workers. Sadly, it's what Portlanders get for voting in libtards. And, keeping them. They can change it.. If I were the police union I’d be organizing a nationwide strike. Enough is enough.. That’s what they get for defunding the police. They deserve it because they voted for whoever in charge.. “Good luck with that”- Oregon State Police. It is an ongoing futile situation, because of inept liberal democrats taking their cues from the Washington D.C. inept liberal democrats.. Law abiding citizens need to ban together and run their mayor, DA and everyone else in charge out of town.. Did they send out unarmed social workers instead? 😂. Sorry Portland but you elected officials who won't stand up to rioters and anarchists. I don't feel bad for you at all. You voted for socialists and this is what you got. Have you learned anything yet?. Time for some water cannons!!!. Where is the Community Services Resource Strike Force Team?. That’s your future Portland unless you get your act together.. defund the police, so why should they respond???. Stand with Trump and take our country back!!!!. The beautiful PNW city Portland destroyed by the left. Very sad.. Hopefully the people of Oregon will wake up.. Portland, one of the first cities to fall.. Cops should stage a walk out and sit back and watch the city burn. Then pull all federal money out of the state and tell’em good luck.. Go Bill Barr!!! They messed up for disrespecting you the way they did in that hearing. Pain coming.. Have the people of Portland learned their lesson for electing democrats?. Wonder how those people of the 60 emergency calls to 911 now feel about defunding the police  and their citiy leaders.. This is a shameful disgrace.

Do some research, enlighten your sheltered mind.. Joseph Brown REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER TRUST TRUMP , NOT AGAIN. …See More. Amanda Williams It is the city's responsibility to pay for the damage when they don't support the police and officers that would've stopped this. Since the mayor told police to stand down, who should've stopped this?. Right.  We have to be “safe” towards our fellow man by wearing a mask and distancing, at the SAME time people are attacking others and their businesses.. Kathleen Ziska Terlizzi its a must for us to do so.But here in Africa we dont take this virus serious. Sue the city big time! That is the only way things will change--if it hits the city money wise.  Go for it, get a huge settlement.. Yes please! Sue the city big time for allowing this to happen! (Breach of duty by these so-called leaders) These people are trying to work and survive... Stealing is stealing! No excuse!. The city will probably charge the shop owner for having glass on the sidewalk. That's what they did in minneapolis..charged a business burned to the ground $3k for a fence the city out up around the rubble. So much lawlessness, we need to stop defunding law enforcement!. This was not stopped by the mayor or govenor. Time for everyone to take a stand in all that they have worked so hard for. However it will take a long time since nothing was done in the beginning when it should have.. Good. I hope they all sue. It's a breach of duty by these so-called leaders and they need to be held accountable!. More business owners and people who have had their property destroyed or threatened should sue the city and the state,.. ALL the business owners should sue that mayor! And it should happen in every city that has had looting & destruction.. Good , they allowed this to happen . You have a right as an American citizen to be protected. Absolutely correct to sue the city.  The mayor is shameful.. 2nd Amendment should take care of that real quick if people would learn how to defend themselves!. Hope you sue for lots , you deserve every penny because Chicago fired  police that are supposed to be there to protect their citizens. Be STRONG and BEST OF LUCK !👍🙏👍. This is the America of the Democrats and that’s exactly why our Great President Trump Will Indeed Win Big Time. Good Day and God bless.. As he should. The Mayor should also be held criminally liable. Ordering the police to stand down should make you an accessory to the crime.. I don't  know what officials are planning but whatever ...it is NOT working to protect their citizens and their ability to own and run their business. I don't  think they have mental capacity to govern.. Sue them... they failed to do their jobs as elected officials.  Unfortunately, these officials are immune to lawsuits.. the process takes time and before you know it... they are out of office or there's another distraction.... FORCE THEM ALL OUT OF OFFICE.. All the stores need to leave and let the mayor deal with it seeing she is not helping stop this. As well he should.  The Mayor has done absolutely nothing to stop anarchy.. Sue the mayor who allowed the anarchists and looters to stay. Sounds like they need to infuse the police with funds instead of defunding...it's a shame. Time to take your businesses out of Chicago.. Because it’s those darn convenience stores that cause so much “oppression”. Chicago mayor and DA should be held personally responsible.. They can thank Lightfoot who has allowed this to happen.. stop voting for Democrats, yes it's really that simple. A class action suit seems in order. There is strength in numbers. The only problem is collecting from a bankrupt city and state.. Exactly why we cannot have Democrats in office. Turn the whole country RED in 2020!!!!. He should just sit in the store with a gun and protect himself with the second amendment. Shoot one and the rest will run out. Hope he wins and then takes that money and moves his business somewhere where he can count on elected officials to actually defend his business and the law abiding citizens.. .... All the stores should sue the city and if they can't get money, get tax breaks or Zero property tax ...... Good Lord! What is happening to Democrats run cities? Portland, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Minneapolis. Why people why?. Should sue Chicago  , the BLM marxist and Antifa organizations  and the democratic party. ....all are guilty  !. I wish every business owner would move out and let these thugs kill each other and wipe Chicago off the map. I have zero sympathy. Mayor Beetlejuice maybe can justify?????. I think we need to send all the liberals to just one sanctuary town and let them just tear the hell out of it and let them live in those kind of conditions.. Chicago has had nothing but record high murders and garbage to report for the last ??? Years...why? Do good people even live there? If so why?. Arm yourself AND sue the governor, mayor and city. Crazy!!  WHO  raised  the  people  doing  this?  Never  in  my  wildest  worst  times  would  I ever  do  something like  this...NEVER!. Think hard before you vote!  You’re seeing just how important your choices are.. Avoid Chicago at all costs... I cannot fathom how anyone could possibly believe destroying the livelihoods of your fellow neighbors is productive in anyway.... How does destroying businesses that provide services to your area help in anyway? They are hurting their own communities by limiting supplies to everyone also. Imagine if that were your own business and people did that to you? Where are these peoples humanity?. Good for the shop owner, all businesses and private citizens  who have had their business and private properties vandalized and/or looted should be bringing class action suits against the mayors and governors who are allowing this to happen!  There are still laws against this ENFORCE THEM!. Macy's is moving out of downtown. Hopefully all the other businesses follow suit in Chicago. I couldn't imagine owning a business down there right now.. So Sad! Firearms are the answer as you drop each and every person coming in to loot your home or business!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸. I'd sue the city, the idiotic mayor and the worthless governor!!. I’m tired of the excuse the rioters give by saying “they have insurance they can rebuild” when they destroy a business. What about those who work there? Those who needs that job to pay their bills? You trash their business and burn it to the ground, those people are out of work. Hoping these businesses learn a lesson to not set up shop in these Democrat run cities that are letting everything burn. According to Nadler this is just the same clip being shown over and over again.  The rest of the democratics especially in DC say this is peaceful protest.  Democratics should be held accountable.  Those that allow this to happen for political gain..

This reality of nature does not bother me, but it runs counter to most of these comments.. Pat Bosler exactly 😢. I always wonder how do they dry themselves.

Not one single well vetted source in your conversation. Eco wackos get frustrated because they can't make their point and they start trying to change the subject, obfuscate, redirect and misdirect.

I completely believe everything you say. So informative and such leadership.. Bob Ureey sure, basing important decisions and how they are administered should be based on your twisted worldview and anecdote. Because someone disagrees with you they're childish. You unprepossessing balatron.. Bob Ureey oil is a finite resource, don’t get me wrong here, I race motorcycles, own a diesel van etc but eventually fossil fuels will run out. Maybe it’s better to be investing in some alternative technologies such as hydrogen etc now so that we are prepared globally for the demise of fossil fuels! Just a thought.. Bob Ureey Every inch will be destroyed, as it has in the past, which is why protective legislation was put in place initially.. Frederick Dallinger Like you ever visit there. And if you did you’d have a hard time finding it. Substantially damaging a pristine refuge is repugnant in and of itself, but doing so when our energy situation makes it unnecessary is truly depraved. Remember this and other assaults on our environment on November 3rd.. Peter Schaffer we should use other nations oil first.. Russell Haughey its called renewable resources.  This government refuses to see that it actually works.  Eventually we will have dug all over, ruined land, and still run out of oil..

521,Say it with us: END THE SCHOOL-TO-PRISON PIPELINE,"We need to end police on campus! Bring back  school counselors. I was shocked when I was looking at middle schools for our daughter and found that there was an officer in uniform on campus at all times! For 5th thru 8th grade! Stop it! Our schools are so too heavy with administration, it's time to define what is necessary there!. i remember going to public school and they had to start bringing in police because of violent liberals. Church of Political Correctness You should be institutionalized.. Desiree Hrebtov one of these days we will find someone who will standup for our views.  Sure, they will probably get humiliated in a debate too,  BUT at least we will be standing up for ourselves!!! That will probably make the KKK mad!. Starting in the 1980's the US stopped hospitalizing the mentally ill and started incarcerating them, why is anyone surprised that they are doing it to physically disabled folks too?  Incarceration is the American answer to poverty, unemployment, and disability, it's what we do best, and with great enthusiasm.. Michael Garrison sadly, you are right.  Reagan closed the public hospitals and the mentally ill were on the streets.  Now many people want to get “those kids” away from their kids.  I work in special education.  I hear it and it makes me nauseous—from administrators to outspoken parents.. The most common consequence for children sent to jail is their failing that grade, because they have too large of a gap in their learning to catch up. Probably the 2nd most common consequence is their acquiring new friends (criminal friends.) The least likely consequence is rehabilitation. For some reason the government finds this unimportant.... Defund the racist public school system. Students with disabilities are the butt of all jokes. The other kids blame them for everything because they know the teacher will believe them and reprimand the student with a disability. I know this from experience.. This is why I Moved back to Canada. When we were in several school systems in the US, I could see them starting to treat my son like a criminal.  I wasn't having it, and now he's doing brilliantly. ...can not end that; it's a proven money-making niche.... As a teacher of emotionally Impaired students this is pretty much my kids exactly.  They are most likely to wind up in the system.  They get identified early, they generally have teachers who cannot or will not learn how to handle them and spend more t…See More. When I was in grade school in the '80's kids weren't arrested - disabled or not! I never heard about that. Have parents really become THIS inept as not be able to teach their own kids how be behave in school/society? Are you kidding me!!. A catholic school principal tried to set my son up.  Tried to accuse him of violence against an aide.  The aide told the truth; she had not followed his IEP, which directly led to a small, non-violent outburst.

549,"Posted @withregram • @nlg_seattle  Learn more about NLG legal observers in Seattle! #NLG #NLG_SEA #SeattleProtest #SeattleProtests #Seattle  —  WHAT ARE LEGAL OBSERVERS?  WHO ARE LOs?  Legal Observers are lawyers, law students, and legal workers trained to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.  Legal observers monitor police behavior, not protesters.  Legal observers are identifiable by neon green hats that say “National Lawyers Guild” and black vests with neon labels.  ON THE GROUND Legal observers watch and document police interactions with protesters to deter violent police tactics and for later legal advocacy in criminal and civil cases.  When protesters are arrested, we get necessary info to connect arrestees with legal and community support.  We make sure that the right to protest is protected and support protesters when they are targeted by the state.  LEGAL PROTECTIONS When a group request legal observers, we establish an attorney-client relationship with the organizers so that our work stays confidential.  This means notes, photos, and videos we take have an extra layer of protection and cannot be turned into evidence without organizer consent.  We seek to provide as much legal protection as possible for protesters and all legal observers are trained in preserving confidentiality.  WHAT WE DON’T DO We cannot give legal advice on the ground, we cannot participate in protests or planning, and we must try to maintain some separation from protesters.  We do not monitor or judge protest tactics or tone. We do not pass judgment on “good” or “bad” protesters, a distinction our chapter rejects.  We do not work with police or act as liaisons between police and protesters. We do not release info to media without explicit consent.  OTHER PROTEST SUPPORT�NLG’s Mass Defense Program includes legal observation on the ground, know your rights trainings, jail hotlines and jail support for those arrested during protest, and legal representation in protest cases.

Micki Hussung the easiest thing to do is first, stop voting republican.2 temper your reaction when you hear things designed to inspire anger against minorities.. Task police with protecting the protesters instead of beating them?Support people exercising their 1A rights?. Isaac Herington well its not tempering MY reaction...I don't have a hateful heart. And I know so many who don't either. So when we know there are SOME people who hold onto racist beliefs...what kind of solution can we get to that doesn't destroy innocent people? I genuinely like these types of conversation because it is impossible to come to 1 solution that works for everyone.. So the better way of life for the cowardly protesters is to beat a man to death and then demand the police protect them while they destroy the city. 🤣🤣🤣. Andrew Harris Our 1st amendment doesn't support people destroying property or raping and beating random civilians 🙄. Also defund the police and fund public safety so the cops will stop gassing people, beating them, and destroying property like slashing tires and bashing car windows open. Bullsh*t. I’ve seen the video. He had been attempting to protect a trans woman that the “protesters” were in the process of beating and robbing and then when he attempted to escape the seen, the “protesters” surrounded his vehicle, caused him to crash, pulled him from his vehicle, and beat him unconscious. F*ck the “protesters.”. Why are they still allowed to do this?. I am hearing where the driver has just passed away...can anyone else confirm this?. Crashed his truck....wtf. He died!. Jeannine Arbuckle I cant find where he died .... Jeannine Arbuckle he deleted what he said so you didn't see it, but he said 'good' that why he is apologizing. Brent Koenig Sorry I didn't mean it.

If the answer is no, you're not alone. Maybe it's time to shrink the number of statewide elected officials and put the responsibility of some offices under the control of the governor. Ultimately, this would increase public accountability, writes Jason Mercier of the Washington Policy Center in an Op-Ed.","These positions should remain elected positions so those elected are accountable to the public.  Making them appointed positions would increase the likelihood elected officials would appoint their cronies.  We have enough of that in DC now..

My former advisor was a great scholar, a good person, and a hard worker...but just wasn't a great 'fit' for me in terms of temperament and what kind of mentorship works best for me. My current advisor ticks a lot of the same boxes, but his temperament is far more complementary to mine, and it has made a huge difference.. Shaun Russell former advisor wasn't a fit for you or you weren't a fit for him 😃. Shaun Russell  - I’m just trying to understand; how can someone not be a good fit for a good person? The worst thing is when you end up with some supervisor who’s a bad person and doesn’t care about people.. Milan Toma For me, it's about advising style and expectations...when to put a lot of pressure on the advisee, for instance, and when to be more friendly and encouraging. The 'iron sharpens iron' approach doesn't work well with me personally. Lol, so basically an incoming grad student needs to have such a sharp innate sense of human psychology so they can “smell” the advisors with good vs bad personalities during the short amount of time at visit days. That, or be able to discern which of the upperclassmen stories are most plausible.. Cara G. Chapel I see, that totally makes sense. In my case, I didn't have direct help like that from any professors during my undergrad, it was more about looking up professors online, chatting with grad students from different programs etc. Either way…See More. Lindsay Rachel ^ Yup, exactly this. I was truly concerned that if I switched advisors, there would be repercussions of some sort, but it turned out that after I passed comps, my advisor himself told me something along the lines of. Jenna Lynn Cody this is why liberal arts colleges are better.  I maintain contact and advising with my students for years after they graduate.. Baftă Irina!. Shaun Russell if only that was true for my program. Seems to depend on the reputation/prestige of the mentor your leaving whether it is possible. Instead I had no choice but to leave my program entirely once working with my mentor was no longer an option for me.. Haha, yeah, it’s definitely a survival of the fittest, but so are most things in life. Lol, I didn’t take myself too seriously when I commented, and I was not expecting so many responses. Very interesting perspectives!. Also, you can always do your research. Specially contacting former students can be very helpful.. Irina Cristali Seconding what Shaun said. I came in and selected my advisor based on like research interests. He's an amazing scholar and was a fantastic advisor, but he wasn't into the signature research methodology of my program.

Interview potential PIs as intensely as they're interviewing potential grad students. You're 'auditioning' them as much as they're evaluating you. Don't just hope to get accepted to any program. Because when things go badly it's awful for everyone involved. It's extremely important to select a program based on an advisor that will work well with you..

Irina Cristali more like ask the right questions and don't be afraid to ask around. Irina Cristali 'Survival of the fittest' I wish it was as simplistic as that. Spend a few years at UChicago and you will realize.. Irina Cristali I think it is more about identifying your most productive work conditions and how you work best with a manager/advisor and then having an honest conversation with potential advisors before you make a decision.. I chose my MS advisor poorly and it was the worst decision of my life. My MS was an absolute nightmare. I had to fire my entire committee and form a new one to graduate. Fortunately my advisor for my PhD was awesome. Otherwise there's no way I'd have been able to stick through it to the end.. Well said. I chose poorly for my PhD, finding someone who matched my research interest and purportedly had expertise to offer, but had no vested interest in mentoring. Seeing as I developed my own funding, was working full time, and a new father, the a…See More. Melissa Pardi I am not denying it, just asking how...? As a grad student, I have very commonly worked in the lab 9am-7pm, weekends included. And considering that day has 24 hours, plus one has to sleep, I dont see the math here. I guess it depends on the field, but in chemistry, grad school is a full time (and more) job. If you cannot invest your time into it, it is quite impossible to succeed.. Most of my friends in anthropology had jobs, because they didn't have departmental support. They also tended to take on average 8-10 years to complete a PhD.. Romi It really is based on discipline--some of us can/need to balance FT jobs and studies. If anything, that's even more important when choosing a mentor because I would hate to have one who felt I wasn't dedicated enough bc I need to work. My FT emplo…See More. My full time job was at the university conducting research, and I developed additional funding to address my PhD interests. And, I was pretty adamant about living a balanced life without being taken advantage of by unreasonable demands. That didn’t sit…See More. Romi Jarošová the “how” may vary by discipline. My dad did his PhD while working FT in administration at a 2 yr technical college and 5 of us 7 children still lived at home (youngest was already 9 or so though, no infants). His university was also a 45 minute drive away. His discipline was English though, so lab work wasn’t part of it.  I’m not sure he slept and he did take 7.5 yrs to finish but he made it work.. It very much seems that a handful of mentors swap mentees into faculty openings and that it does not matter at all how brilliant or ground breaking the research is of the poor saps who didn’t work with these gate keepers.. Wes Grooms spot on. Wes Grooms yup. I know what you are talking about. If one individual relationship can make or break a career, perhaps it is time to put all our brilliant, critical minds to work on alternatives to the current structures.. Yes,  one  person  shouldn’t  have  that  much  power  over  someone  else’s career.  It’s all  well  and  good to  tell  new  researchers  to  choose  their  mentors wisely,  but  how  are  they  to  know  which  ones  turn  out  to  be  psychopaths?. I made some bad choices from the get-go. Some were my fault; others were not. I ended up having to ask my MA thesis advisor (from a different university) to co-chair my dissertation committee. If it were not for him, I would have quit. Drove 350 miles to nurse me through comps, which were very much like swimming though a pool of broken glass. I picked my mentors because I admired their work. Luckily for me, they are also two wonderful human beings. I wouldn't have made it through my program without their support.. It sometimes can be really tough to tell, especially when the advisors are very manipulative and are able to convince their current students that the toxic environment they created is normal. If you end up with an advisor that doesn’t workout, your car…See More. Absolutely the truth. My mentor coached me through my MA, then hired me as full-time faculty only a year after I finished my PhD. She is the reason I went into academia and I can never thank her enough.. My dissertation committee has been out to lunch the entire time—except for the head. He gets done what needs done—but offers no encouragement. He just clicks the boxes. I’m months away from finishing and I will absolutely never teach at a public university. It’s turned me away.. I've chosen my university through my supervisors. While for me it was the logical thing to do and I was lucky those folks wanted to work with me, you never know whether relationships may change down the road. They can get better but they can also get worse.. My mentor is now in his 80s. I spend a week with him and his wife every summer. He has dementia, it is rapidly progressing, and I have a textbook that was just published that I dedicated to him. I am trying so hard to get him a copy while he can still recognize how I'm honoring him ☹️. It's breaking my heart, he is SO important to me, still. ❤️ A good mentor changes your life.. They can also make or break your mental health. You're extremely reliant on this person and spending a good deal of time with them. You want to make sure you're a good match research-wise, but also personality. Having an advisor that I communicated well with and was supportive was the only reason I finished my PhD.. Alexis Layman Mraz This is so true! The amount of pressure is already too high and when the matches are not good, it can lead to burnout.. So much this! I left grad school (ABD) in part due to poor mentorship. I went on to a career evaluating graduate and postdoc programs, and strong mentorship was always one of the most important factors in making a program and it's participants successful. Not enough is said about this to starry-eyed undergrads looking for the right name..  I had some trouble with this during my Master’s. I learned that valuable lesson before the PhD. I am incredibly fortunate to have had an amazing PhD chair and two amazing committee members.. Yep, I chose mine based off of research AND personality (totally ignored university prestige and location). Best decision I ever made - she was and still is unwaveringly supportive, not only of my research but of my physical and mental health.The way…See More. How many students can become suicidal and make attempts because of a supervisor....? So far our count is 4 and it’s continuing after changing supervisor. Absolutely choose your supervisor carefully.. In practicality, it’s better to have a poorer mentor and more well-received institution. From what I’ve seen, this holds true in academia and industry contexts alike.. Definitely. Advice for prospective grad students: don't just interview your potential supervisor before making a decision: if possible, reach out to their former students as well.. I have a friend who's been through hell, is on the verge of quitting altogether, after many years, because of her mentor. I also think that it's almost impossible to tell. I think university needs to be rethought and recycled.. I had no idea who I wanted to mentor me during my doctorate. Got very lucky and met my supervisor at a lecture in the first week. I had no idea if he was even interested in my research topic but I knew I had to ask... five years later I wrote something I am so proud of that I actually hope it gets published eventually. The right mentors make or break.. When you come from a poor background, you get chosen by the scholarship team. You have zero say in either the university or the mentor.. The words are the truth - if you fail to pick mentor that is good for you - this doctoral experience can and will be a nightmare for  you.  Look at your mentor's vitae - see if they work with students and if they do - who is the lead author on student'…See More. Kris Machtmes exactly..

Turns out she didn't chose me for my project or my intellect. Rather the fee…See More. Also, there was only one person at the university I could have changed  to as advisor. Guess who he was married to.... Also, don’t forget that students pick advisors. Mentors pick themselves, with a little encouragement from the student.. So true - It broke me for many, many years . Still no closure or accountability for egos or downright lies to cover backs.. I chose mine based off research interests and my experience with them through undergrad. WOW was that a stunningly bad move. How staff treat non-threatening undergrads and how they treat postgrad students who can question them can be very different.. The whole advisory team is important in terms of having a mix of expertise that the student can tap into, and varying approaches to supervision/training/support. I was very lucky during my honours and PhD, and got different things from my different supervisors. It's something I try to replicate now when putting together supervisory teams for my students.. One tool for figuring this out is to use social media and their website to see what credit they give to their research students. Are the authors diverse? Do the students get lead credit? Are the students presenting their research or is the faculty doing it all? Social media has really changed the game.. Absolutely agree with this - all the prestige in the world won't mean squat if you don't finish and get a good piece of work out of it, and that won't happen if you and your supervisor don't gel. I turned down a place to study my PhD at Cambridge to wo…See More. And do lab  rotations if you can!. Don't confuse a supervisor with a mentor in the first place. They're different things.. My grad advisor used me to do his work and hindered my work. He was absolutely lacking in every way.. This was the best and biggest tip my Honors Thesis supervisor gave me in undergrad and I will always and forever be thankful to him for it!. Congratulations for finding a fit mentor; I couldn't find any, fit or otherwise.I'll be thankful if I get a relevant postdoc mentor right now.. I changed my university from Cornell to Univ. of New Mexico to work with the right advisor. I never regretted that decision until he passed away 2 months before my defence.. Tijen Tunali Oh wow! That sounds horrible! Amazing that you still graduated though! And cool that you are in Europe too! I’d actually be interested to talk to you about our experiences and now being in Europe and all that - would you mind if I sent you a message?. Jana Wilbricht The story gets more tragic while waiting for an advisor to replace my prof.and she was the biggest manipulator I have met in my life. It took me 3 years to graduate with a finished dissertation. I am back to Europe too :). I chose a great school with vastly less prestige than a top 3 choice I had in my field precisely because I had great options for a mentor!. How do you see if your potential advisor is a good fit or not if you have never met/worked with them?. 伍昭明 exactly what I have heard from my colleagues. I agree that talking to the students is important for some kind of second/third opinions. But perhaps some students are not comfortable to speak frankly about their PI especially if the students will still be working for them for a long time.. You should meet with them at least once.  I mean you're going to be working closely with them for years.  Talking with their current and former students is also a good way to determine their mentor style.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to their current students without the PI present. Ask them straight what it's like to work with the PI and what their expectations are.. Fadil Habibi Danufane you will be able to tell whether they actively like the professor or just reluctant to criticize him/her due to other concerns. Fadil Habibi Danufane I met with several prospective advisors remotely, never in person.. 伍昭明 definitely. I think you can't be shy to work with another mentor if it becomes evident that the fit isn't right.  A bad fit might not be evident at first.. I asked a lot of questions, including their mentoring philosophy, expectations, how they approach various scenarios, how they like to give feedback, how often they like to meet, how writing papers with them works, how decisions are made, stuff like that. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to them ahead of time, talk to their students, read between the lines in what the students say. Look at their past students—where are they now? If it’s a newer PI, reach out to past undergrad mentees. A new pi should be willing to give references to them.. You can read about them and see if they are a bad fit for everyone or not.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to former and current students. it's so hard to know what to even ask if you've never experienced it.... but one good one is 'how is work life balance ?'. Talking to current/former students is tricky. 10 people, 10opinions. I loved my advisor when I was ar grad school, while there where people who really didnt like him and decided to leave.. Fadil Habibi Danufane Rolling the dice on whether or not a positive interaction is indicative of a positive future relationship with someone directly in your field of interest is definitely superior to just YOLOing a school for name recognition and hoping for the best. That was a long sentence.At least try to Zoom or phone interview with people beforehand. It is worth it.. Big red flag: they don't graduate many students in a reasonable amount of time. This is easy to find out.. In academia (at least in the US), the status of the university defines everything. The rest is b.....t. I'd love to be able to find the funding to go with my supervisor of choice but sadly that not currently happening 😭😭😤. The same applies when picking graduate students.. Choose carefully for  the short term and the long term  both.. Hard to do when one is assigned!. I learnt that the hard way.. Pat Owen does this count as a citation?. Definitely read it at first to be referring to our study! Might have to count it just to be on the safe side ;). Travel time and tell me this...  maybe I’d still be doing science and not drywall. And that isn’t a joke...  if you find yourself in a masters degree with an advisor who hates you...  GTFO, industry if you can..  unless you want to do a “underpaid” internship...  and if you think science is awesome and that could never happen...  got some news for you. Zarmeen Khan  yup yup yup..

Cara G. Chapel Yes. I had a great Ph.D. Advisor but I had asked a professor that I thought would be supportive to be on the committee. After he said yes, I heard from other students and faculty about how he did what you described. Fortunately, for me, he took a job elsewhere about 6 months before I defended. I have never been so glad to see a moving truck leave.. I'm not in academia but health care and you speak the truth. When I was attempting to get admission to a PhD program, I was given absolutely horrible advice from my half brother, an asshole, which helped sink me. I did not know better.

614,‪How to make your Zoom look more professorial,"I`m giving a conference-presentation on Zoom next week and I was thinking that it`s going to look weird with my tidy room. It`s great that someone has taken the time on their busy schedule to make such a thorough instructional video I can utilize to overcome this problem.. Use cats. As long as you have a couple of cute furballs in the back, you could have a skinned, decapitated corpse right next to you and no one would complain. Trust me, I've tried it before. Works like a charm.. I have three cats, I know what you mean 😻. I'm desperately trying to hide that I'm set up in the corner of a room that was never really unpacked. I signed for the house the same week I did my first capstone defense, and setting up the spare bedroom was never a priority. Yesterday, work gave m…See More. It’s missing some random tangled electronic cords that serve no function because the thing no longer works, also: where are the random carrier bags stashed in the corner?? Otherwise nailed it!!. After my defence, when my committee handed me their copies back so I could make my “minor changes”, I literally found someone’s name and phone number written on top of a page on one person’s copy. I could not for the life of me figure out if I was supposed to call that person or not.. I think you should call Human Resources... after you're done, of course, just to play it safe.... André Guerreiro lol, just to clarify, this was more than a decade ago.. This is amazing. Please call the number.. I'm under the impression that many commentors here have not watched the actual video (it's humour wink wink). Tom As Veines yeah that’s pretty clear.. That's a relief. I'm gonna need to see a couple of dead, dusty plants in the corner.  Otherwise the he look isn't fully professional. 😄. Christina Rivers Now we're talking, thanks!. I was completely called out by this video.. Krista Smith my thoughts exactly. I’m clearing out the dead plants Monday. Effortless but not quite sprezzatura. Sprezzatura is an Italian word that first appears in Baldassare Castiglione's 1528 The Book of the Courtier, where it is defined by the author as 'a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever'. Kimberley Sarah I suspect you're too well organized to feel seen by this video or to feel the need to raid other languages for words to justify a certain nonchalance and lack of planning.. Haha so much effort into appearing nonchalant 😅. No printer paper - printer broke months ago :( There are bookshelves in mine, but not neat at all... And I do, mid-class, break out and say 'oh,  I have a book on that!' and spend 5 minutes shuffling through it.... Which may mean they see my highly proffessional fuzzy slippers, complete with bear claws. 😁👏👏 Oh, he totally nailed it. The only two things missing were a leather satchel and conference lanyards tacked to a bulletin board.. LIterally LOL'd at the photos. My office pictures feature my 2 and 4 year olds being precious, taken about a year after I started the job. They're now 13 and 15. Notably missing are 2 other children and a grandchild.I finally framed and hung my diplo…See More. I recently framed & hung mine,  in year 18. Regalia also usually on the back of the door though for some reason I can’t remember now, I brought it home from the last event. Where it will stay for the foreseeable future.... “Is that a picture of your dog? So cute!” “Uh, yeah... well my old dog... who died... 6 years ago...” “*awkward silence*” “Yeah, I guess I should put some new pictures up in my office.” 😬. Based on assumption that one has an office, lol. Anna Krstevski yeah...#adjunct. No cat making an appearance = a lack of attention to detail. Also a random artefact that says you’re down with the kids, like a Beatles record or a Star Wars poster... and a guitar!. Jokes aside, if you want to look more 'professorial' care about your students, especially now.. ....I'm feeling very attacked right now. Mary Wilkerson me, too!. Who do I call about him breaking into my office to do research?  Dear God, the box his last electronic purchase came in!. How many of y'all who so clearly didn't watch the video also complain about students who don't read your syllabus?. People in the comments are like students who didn’t do the reading talking about the book cover 😂. I feel equally seen and mocked. Where are the conference totes? WHERE ARE THE CONFERENCE TOTES?. As one of Andrew's dear colleagues, I can attest to the authenticity he has tried to create here.. it's canned lime perrier in the actual office though. Andrew Ishak when did you visit my office?. Andrew Ishak I just can’t believe I’m not the only one with white boxes stashed in the corner from my last electronics purchase.... Omg this is so my office. psst almost everybody in the comments needs to... actually watch the video lol it's hilarious. This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever watched.

I decided at this point that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my teaching. …See More. Kristy M Keefe My first semester teaching I got two comments saying to “wear less clothes” 😳 As a new instructor this was not what I was expecting and not helpful in how I could improve as an educator. Sadly, this may have been the first time I received comments about my appearance but it was not the last.. Ugh! That's sexual harassment. I got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt, literally. Kristy M Keefe I had the opposite for the hair. My hair is long and I always wear it down. Student said that I either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is unprofessional.. Students will reach for anything when they want to be negative. One time a student asked me a question about the midterm, and I said I hadn't finished it yet. They mentioned that in my RMP rating, lol. Like they never procrastinate?. Amanda Carroll were you tempted to clap back with ‘do you mean fewer?’ These sites are just nonsense.  Appalling levels of sexual harassment, and not just against women; I’ve known male teachers have similarly inappropriate comments posted.. Kristy M Keefe For sure! 😊. Amanda Greubel nope. I have also had some wonderfully thoughtful comments about my courses. I’ll take the bad with the good.. Angry people en route.... Joshua Shinn How dare you!I'm not angry, I just hate to disappoint anyone.. Being a good prof doesn't hurt either. Michael W.

Being a good professor has nothing to do with good evaluations, and I would go so far to say that the effective professor does not get good reviews. Do be glib though.. 🙄. Woosh.

I doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the stud…See More. My favorite criticism from a student on RMP: “every other professor wants you to succeed. She only cares about how much you learn.” The rest of the review made clear that “success” was just about a specific letter grade.Student evals usually tell us more about students than about teachers.. My favorite criticism on a student eval: “She doesn’t teach us the content, she expects us to learn it ourselves.” Apparently the fact that I don’t lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isn’t “good teaching.” 🤦🏻_♀️. No kiddin'?You mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest.  I'll be damned.. You're not wrong.. Tenure > attractive, any day. Promote these large nostrils and heavy baggaged eyes please.. I won’t lie— the chili peppers are from my nephews. Should I remind that correlation does not mean causation?. Innokenty Kantor you seem to assume that universities hire more poorly qualified non-white non-males over better qualified white males, whereas in reality, the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against people who are more…See More. Innokenty Kantor thanks for explaining my comment for me. Yes because being male or white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges. The way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face bias.. Jacq Jones Not at all. I think it is the opposite: those who think that ANY disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination, are just burying their heads in sand. Because they don't like the implications.. Ransell D'Souza He was trying to write 'of course' in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as 'of cause.' Notice he also replaced the word hire with 'high.' It's probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof. Innokenty Kantor unless you are already hiring inferior candidates who happen to fit your bias - eg white men. In which case expanded the range of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires.. What's of cause?. Innokenty Kantor yes, it’s nice (apologies for not getting reference). I’d love to see this extended to include racial bias because, sadly, I think this would be even more pronounced. And the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at best.. Innokenty Kantor there seems to be a strong correlation that white men don’t believe academia is sexist and racist (backed up by several studies). Seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them,. the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their 'existing culture' (which is really just code for biases towards wht they THINK ideal candidates are like, and the d…See More. Issues with the methodology but not news.. I don’t even look anymore. You must not be an adjunct. I don’t want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs I apply to every year. Well, I get three out of four.. That’s how I do it. 😊. Wait there are adults who actually care about what's written on ratemyprofessor?. No of you should ever, under any circumstances, read Rate My Professor. No good comes of it.  And I FIRMLY believe there should be a “Rate My Student” site. 😑. Mirrors typical life. I don't bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage.. Ditto. Especially after reading a rape fantasy.. I hope you reported that.. Bob Borrelli why? So they can all laugh about it? Pick up lines, graphic sexual fantasies, sexual assault and notes like “pretty sure I found your house” were totally ignored.. Ta-Shana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you.. You brought it to our attention years ago. White? Yes. Male? No. Tenured? Hahaha. Attractive? Um.... Brenna E. Culbert. My favorite comment on RMP was “she has a lot of patience, even with the stupid question people.”. Amanda Evert they repeated your study.. Sarina Kilham. Thanks. Adding it to my stockpile of evidence.. Hadil Ghoneim here you go.. I'm attractive though 😄😄. White? Yes. Male? Yes? Tenured? No. Attractive? Not really. My RMP ratings still suck, although I have a few good ones.. Jess Moore, the most frequent descriptor people use for me is 'boring'. That one cuts me to my soul. I'm fun!. Brian Paul I agree and my ratings are largely good, and even the 'negative ones' are worthwhile 😂😂😂😂. Brian Paul I just got a bad review for giving too much work for a minimester class. I'm not even sure how to take that. Am I supposed to assign less work during a minimester? I was told you're supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now I wonder about that.. Aurora Le well shit. Ami Sedani new study! More like duh lol.  Lisa Parker Lebovitz. Daniel Malcom thanks! I’ve got to get back to the data, I think we can refute this.

You fulfill one of the categories, then.. Good👏🏻for👏🏻you👏🏻. I see you don't understand how studies work. A study never reports that in 100% of cases this happens, and in 0% of cases, this happened. If that were true, providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the study.Studies look at the way things tend to be. Maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but it's not a guarantee one way or the other still.. Funny: race and gender are wwwwaaaayyyyy less important than attractiveness, student interest and discipline, but the first two features in the headline is “white” and “male”. Stop contradicting the facts with your divisive ideology!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Juan Trucupey cool story bro. Catherine Glass it’s easy to laugh when you’re the beneficiary. Juan Trucupey that’s not contradicting facts. It’s emphasising some things that the study found more than others. But I bet the standard of attractiveness and gender interact as well. Juan yes it's all propaganda; it's not like they're just pointing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the obvious ones. Student interest in the subject influences professor ratings? Really? 🤪. Juan Trucupey You're the one who is claiming that it is sexist against males to imply that gender affects ratings before listing a student's interest in the subject matter. I never said that. So your complaint that I'm contradicting myself is wrong - i…See More. Propaganda, lol.. I literally have had female students look for profs who are called a bitch.

And if you do not patron this bar several times every year, you are not allowed to work as an academic.. Barmaid 2 : You should have mixed your drinks with orange juice instead of cranberry juice. But those drinks are only acceptable if they are made with gin  from a recipe that other distillers can replicate exactly as well as hand-crafted tonic water from cinchona bark grown by the Agricultural college and sustainably harvested by graduate students working on stipend. 😉. And students will most likely take a sip of the drink, find the one line they wanna cite, and be done with it.. Abdul Haseeb And gripe that there are multiple FREE gin and tonics in front of them.. you forgot to mention that the person two seats over (the 2nd customer) had a negative opinion of the academic's mixology, and suggested some edits that completely change the composition of the cocktail.. then he is hired and makes this money in a month because his boss simply trust this bar... Editor: it's passed peer review. But someone else for that issue has dropped out and could you rewrite it to about twice length? Oh, and it'll have to go to two different reviewers after that.. Works months or years to prepare the drink*. Daniele Padula it's like if you have to ferment the alcoholic and grow the lemons yourself. Then you have to invent your own drink that has to be slightly different than any drink before.. Daniele Padula exactly my thought! Takes years to make the drink and a few years to get the money to get everything to make those drinks.. This actually exists in real life. You can bring your own drink to a BYOB place and they will charge you an uncorking fee to just sit down and drink it there.. Neşet Özel And there's also the equivalent with cake called 'cakeage'. Makes for an exxy cake.. After paying the $3500, the academic may then be contacted by the bar asking if they want to serve drinks (for free) 2 nights a week for the foreseeable future. The academic accepts. It’s a considerable honour!. Edmund King 😆. Reviewer 2: there is no need to clarify that it's a metaphor. Please delete the last line and instead cite a wonderful paper by (reviewer 2, 1989).. Roee Sarel and add a further £1,000 if you want to illustrate your comments in colour!. Add another €500 for one hard copy of your own paper.. Reviewer 1: the comment clarifying that this is a publishing metaphor has been removed. I feel that this needs to be added so as to provide a stand alone understanding for the naive reader.. Roee Sarel hvae we met?. Roee Sarel Gabriela Rabelo This though^ !!!!! 😂😂😂 When you try and work out who the reviewers are by the papers they suggest xD. Bartender tells the academic they can't drink their drinks till they  format them onto the bar's menu and disclose whether anyone helped them to make the drinks. By then, the ice in the drinks has melted.. The  academic then  pays  to  read  the  labels  on  their  own  bottle.  This  is  also  a publishing  metaphor. Their own ORIGINAL SIGNATURE drinks, with recipes attached.. Then the bar had to shut down since some neighnours claimed they were serving propaganda.. Grammar is poor. Major review 🤣🤣. Wow.  Just, no.  Not a single person I know in academia who does it right experiences this.  No one.. And them you are asked for by that bar to help others bringing their drinks.

650,Why do capitalists hate full employment? Because it weakens their power over workers.,"They don't need to plan for unemployment, the just progressively eliminate human work in order to increase the profit share in the added value.. Marx explains that capitalists try to maintain a 'reserve army of the unemployed' to keep wages down. Yes and so socialists should make a Universal Job Guarantee at a living wage a transitional demand.. Wally Mooney if the JG is voluntary and is not a job created just to keep people working as a way to justify their earnings or even their lives I'm with you. Jobs should not be linked to wages if we want real freedom.. Will Eede Sure. I fully support the battle for a 4 day week also.. Reduce the working time without decreasing wages.That's what workers have been fighting for (and won) for decades, and that put more people to job.More people employed doesn't necessarily imply more wealth produced. It can also be a better repartition between workers of the time used to produce.. Wally, that was enlightening. Thank you.. shouldn't they like it because then they get to exploit more people?. Hanno Sauer I am not going to exert effort showing to you that your assumptions are just that, not logic. It is just not worth it under these conditions.. Brenton Eccles i will leave it to you to 'establish' that a guaranteed entitlement to X won't affect people's motivation to obtain X. Hanno Sauer That is a valid concern, and I think that is why we should be open to incrementalism, to having degrees of competitiveness in markets, etc. All I know is the current system in the US is far from ideal; the power businesses have over people is far too much.. Hanno Sauer the labour market relies on desperation to create downward pressure on wages: when people lack desperation, either because it's easy to find a new job or because wages are high, it puts that mechanism in jeopardy.. Capitalism requires arbitrage of labor: buying the worker's time cheap; selling the product of that work for more than the labor and materials cost; and pocketing the difference. The lower the standing rate of unemployment, the greater the threat to the capitalist's money machine.. Who says that? Because a polish philosopher suggested it in 1943?   What capitalist has ever said such a ridiculous thing?. Slavery was a full-employment system, so we must be careful what we wish for :/. They also don't offer their employees the option to unionize or participate as co-owners.. Shorter hours without loss of earnings is what we needA three day week would provide opportunity for more employees, with more leisure time, improved mental health  and a greater turnover with regard to production.

Todd Hardiman facts?. Keith Price as usual a Trump supporter talks garbage out of his ass without looking into a situation and circumstances, when his president said the virus is / hoax!!!What is wrong with you dude? Have you no desire for the truth? Is it too much work  to learn the truth ? Or are you a sheep that just regurgitates what you are being told by your not so supreme leader and his propaganda of Lies.. Keith Price provide proof otherwise you’re just like the 45th talking out of your a$$. Keith Price OMG you still don’t have your facts right! Unbelievable. Keith, you don’t think he will cover missteps and assumptions, of course he will, he is not Trump who already said he is not accountable.. Keith Price  nailed it!! Keep Forbes accountable! The people aren’t blind.. Keith Price he has blood on his hands yet he praises himself with the Democratic media.. Debbie Comerford wah wah. This!. Well the ship that showed up wasn’t taking covid patients at first. They were for overflow patients. Furthermore the HHS recommended sending the seniors back. So before you spout off, have your facts straight.. Keith Price Bot!. Sam A Nasr hes a bot. Keith Price that's the problem when people (sheeps) just believe what IQ45 says, these people would end like the Waco or Guyana following this Guy 😂😂😂😂😂. Debbie Comerford ....if he did nothing just left it alone...we would have 11 thousand grandparents still with us. They after he realized what a disaster mistake it was he past law that u could not file a lawsuit against the state or nursing homes...Let’s investigate independently stop hiding all the details of this debacle. Keith Price He has taken responsibility and has taken us through this nightmare. He continues to work hard at keeping our COVID numbers below 1%. Maybe if Trump stopped saying it came to the US from China, we could have stopped it as it came in from Europe.. Keith Price   Yes!. Barbara Sausville Johnson dont forget now trying to profit from all those deaths, makes a nice story i guess.. Keith Price Troll. An uneducated one at that!. Keith Price reading that realize stupidity has no limits. I'm sure this will be 100% Accurate and Mention how NY still has the HIGHEST NUMBER of DEATHS!!!Give me a BREAK!  SUCCESS by what measure!  In his LITTLE MIND!. Donald Furr They had the highest because we didn’t know how to treat the disease at that point. We were trying the damn hydroxychloroquine which proved to be ineffective.  Fortunately, the rest of the country learns from their failures and successes.. Donald Furr and what did you do to help?. Donald Furr you seem like an ultra snowflake.  Calm down. Dolly Tewelis DePagter nice try Blame Trump!  Noone tried hydroxychloroquine in NY!  Your Liberal dumbass leaders were too busy sending infected people into nursing homes and crying/bitching about everything!  Highest Number of Deaths that is on Cuomo!!!. Donald Furr You must be a troll 😂😂. Angie Dixon tough measures? Like signing a law that forces COVID patients into nursing homes?. Donald Furr TROLL. Ordering positive Covid patients into nursing homes was not Trumps fault.. Two words: nursing homes!!. Says the man who has killed so many in NYC by his lack of leadership,intelligence and forcing nursing homes to take covid patients.  Also blocking any investigation into his murdering of innocent nursing home people.. Cuomo sentenced almost  20,000 people to their death in nursing homes, The old and most vulnerable among us had no power to stop Cuomo from mandating nursing homes admit Covid positive people. There were thousands of COVID-19 specific beds that the infected people could have recovered in at the arena, hospitals, and the Navy ship.  So about 20,000 people lost their lives because of Cuomo’s malfeasance.. Good he can explain why he murdered over 6,000 seniors in nursing homes with his mandate.. So he forced nursing homes to take covid patients. Last number I read, was 11k deaths in nursing homes...in his state of New York. People then try to open an investigation on that and he blocks it...obviously to cover up his massive mistake. Is that what he’s claiming leadership looks like? What a joke this guy is.. He literally killed thousands with his poor leader ship and decisions in policymaking look at Florida same amount of cases a 10th of the death. What's it called how to kill the most vulnerable? And then say I did a great job. so a man in office is publishing a book detailing government practices during a pandemic that killed millions is gonna profit from all this death and fear?? And he's aloud?. That was his plan all along once  COVID-19  showed up in New York and I bet Freddo his bother  will be the ghostwriter of his book.. Will he be talking about decimating the NY economy in the face of this pandemic?Cuomo is a joke.. It was Cuomos fault that he did not take measures to enforce strict quarantine and face masks, reduce movement and transport to reduce infection. No wo der NY has the highest rates of infection and deaths in the world.. I hope he will confess in the book how hydroxychloroquine cured his brother ... but he continues discrediting the cheap med that can save lives. Does it include him infecting nursing homes? Or the collapse of Americas largest city? NY is headed for collapse under Cuomo and DeBlasios watch. Step one, keep everything open and encourage life to go on. Step two, close everything and blame President for keeping  everything open. Step three, force nursing homes to take known cases of the virus knowing they lack the ability to isolate and car…See More.

He is crying for money ,he is going to need it with all the lawsuits from the seniors family members.. Will he talk about having money ties that made him mandate the elderly that tested positive return to their nursing home causing a lot of death all alone. So glad Florida knows how to take care of our elderly. He was the worst in the country lol. So capitalising off of death by selling books... I'm sorry but both sides are fucking useless...... For  those  new  yorkers  and  califonians  relocating  to  red  states  please  make  sure  you  leave  behind  ur  liberal and  stupid  mentality behind  .... With his experience, I hope his book is on “what not to do”!!!. Will it include how he put COVID patients in nursing homes, which killed thousands and then he blamed it on others? Prospering on the death of others is sickening.. Will it be titled, How Democrats let me get away with murder.. Can always be used as Doorstop. You people realize cuomo can be trash and still be speaking the truth when it comes to trump right?. Re-writing history, by the FX channel oops no Cuomo has its own science fiction channel.. No one to blame for NY other than yourself and DiBlasio.. Is he going to tell how he killed.the elderly in nursing homes.. New York has the highest death toll in the country  🙄. Don’t forget to tell them about all the nursing home deaths for which you are responsible. That’s REAL leadership – thinning the herd.. It wasnt that great..he worried about dearhs..but not deaths by abortion. Cartoon picture book? Hopefully comes with a lesson on state responsibility and a four pack of crayons.. Front cover of book should have a giant Q-tip shoved up his nose by his brother.  Great humor after the death of so many.. Maybe he can explain how NY was destroyed.

That would be crushing blow to Republicans. The Democrats have broadened their support as the Republicans become the party of the Klan and curly Qanon. Lining up the comedians and traitors.. Kasich is the man to do it, he is a true lying Democrat in a Rhino suit. Just don’t be a sheep.. Disappointed with the DNC, Kasich and this crew are not considered influential outside the liberal wing of the RNC and independents.. Kasich is a sore loser and a life long politician..

And finally, go away!. Maybe Kasich can run as a moderate Democrat next cycle.. You are a presidential candidate loser  who cares what you say not changing  my mind. Trump 2020!. I wish John Kasich was running again.. No one will be watching!. John, doesn’t Joe lie about golfing and about everything else?  (RNC 2012). Kasich is still butt sore from 2016.

And out of all of them, the one that made me lose weight was running 5 miles a day.. Running is cruel and unusual punishment. 😣😂. If you want to lose weight quickly, stop over eating.

Du Bois, legendary, esteemed scholar and eventual “Pan Africanist,” intoxicated by his White features, during an accommodationist breakdown, once refer...red to the honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. as a ""little, fat, black man; ugly, but with intelligent eyes and a big head.""  At the time, Garvey led the largest, in the millions, and most unified Black/Negro activist collective in the Western world. A feat, to date, no one has ever duplicated. In contrast, feeling less relevant and jealous of Garvey, Du Bois, an “intellectual,” resorted to racist, White beauty standard inspired name-calling. Years later, much too late for Garvey to benefit, who had since died (he was eventually set-up and deported), after it became crystal clear to Du Bois that his belief in White benevolent partnership with Black liberation struggle was flawed, he would regret how he treated Garvey.  He finally had to admit to himself that Garvey was right, and, contaminated by Whiteness, he was wrong.  A part of how Du Bois atoned for his behavior was to leave his so-called high-brow academic perch, and move to Ghana, West Africa.  He became a true Pan Africanist, living the rest of his life surrounded by first-blood Africans, that he realized were quite beautiful.   Today, we can all honor Dr. Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr.","DuBois really made a huge shift from his liberalism to embracing Pan-Africanism and communism. He even had a good laugh with Mao.

On November 14, 1848 3, sailed, from Cork harbor alone: 147 bales of bacon, 120 casks and 135 barrels of pork, 5 casks of hams, 149 casks of miscellaneous provisions (foodstuff); 1,996 sacks & 950 barrels of oats; 300 bags of flour; 300 head of cattle; 239 sheep; 9,398 firkins of butter; 542 boxes of eggs.  On July 28, 1848 4; a typical day's food shipments from only the following four ports: from Limerick: the ANN, JOHN GUISE and MESSENGER for London; the PELTON CLINTON for Liverpool; and the CITY OF LIMERICK, BRITISH QUEEN, and CAMBRIAN MAID for Glasgow. This one-day removal of Limerick's food was of 863 firkins of butter; 212 firkins, 1,198 casks and 200 kegs of lard, 87 casks of ham; 267 bales of bacon; 52 barrels of pork; 45 tons and 628 barrels of flour; 4,975 barrels of oats and 1,000 barrels of barley.  From Kilrush: the ELLEN for Bristol; the CHARLES G. FRYER and MARY ELLIOTT for London. This one-day removal was of 550 tons of County Clare's oats and 15 tons of its barley.  From Tralee: the JOHN ST. BARBE, CLAUDIA and QUEEN for London; the SPOKESMAN for Liverpool. This one-day removal was of 711 tons of Kerry's oats and 118 tons of its barley.  From Galway: the MARY, VICTORIA, and DILIGENCE for London; the SWAN and UNION for Limerick (probably for transshipment to England). This one-day removal was of 60 sacks of Co. Galway's flour; 30 sacks and 292 tons of its oatmeal; 294 tons of its oats; and 140 tons of its miscellaneous provisions (foodstuffs). British soldiers forcibly removed it from its starving Limerick, Clare, Kerry and Galway producers.  In Belmullet, Co. Mayo the mission of 151 soldiers 5 of the 49th Regiment, in addition to escorting livestock and crops to the port for export, was to guard a few tons of stored meal from the hands of the starving; its population falling from 237 to 105 between 1841 and 1851. Belmullet also lost its source of fish in January, 1849, when Britain's Coast Guard arrested its fleet of enterprising fishermen ten miles at sea in the act of off-loading flour from a passing ship. They were sentenced to prison and their currachs were confiscated. The Waterford Harbor British army commissariat officer wrote to British Treasury Chief Charles Trevelyan on April 24, 1846; ""The barges leave Clonmel once a week for this place, with the export supplies under convoy which, last Tuesday, consisted of 2 guns, 50 cavalry, and 80 infantry escorting them on the banks of the Suir as far as Carrick."" While its people starved, the Clonmel district exported annually, along with its other farm produce, approximately 60,000 pigs in the form of cured pork.","Physically painful to remember.

874,What a clown. Michelle Obama is way more intelligent than him.,"But they don’t like it when we say something about the his immigrant wife!. Lilia Garcia Ozuna you mean the hooker Vampira?. His illegal immigrant wife. Violated her visa.. Lilia Garcia Ozuna he has had two immigrant wives. Lilia Garcia Ozuna you mean the gold digger, naked model that has the genius visa??????? That one ......... Erich T Matola you must mean HOTUS!. I have Never heard him defend Melania. Idalia Mandgie Correct!!!. He must have sent his lawyers to screw his brother's widow by now.  Cause know he doesn't seem to be too broke up over it.. AND he wants to have the funeral at The White House so WE can pay for it!. Lee Ann Sigmon-Farley he was having brain bleeds , on blood thinners, was in ICU in June for many days then got released to file a lawsuit against his niece, apparently had a fall and last 2 weeks couldn't speak, so got readmitted to the hospital again to die within 24 hrs (Donald went to say goodbye for 45 minutes on Friday then went back to his scheduled events)! Apparently it was Strokes!. Carolyn Franklin he went. He did that with daddys will when dear old daddy died.. Carolyn Franklin wow that was Biden's son to a t thx. Judith Scobee thanks.. Trump went to the movies when his brothers was dying. He went golfing when this brother was dying. No mention of hi. Going to the funeral.. Unfortunately he still has supporters, they think just like him!! I can't understand how any person with a heart and a brain that works would do that!!!. This is crazy and wrong. I worry about children whose first memories of a president is this rude, ranting buffoon.. At least her speech wasn't  plagiarized!Sick OLD MAN needs to go home and cuddle up with a blanket in his rocking chair.. He is senile.  Michelle Obama is an esteemed grad of a few prestigious schools.  I bet she'd share her grades.  Classy lady.  Maybe Natasha will have a harder time aPlagerizzing from a recorded speech.. Be Best, donnie!!! Your 3rd current wife, won't  like it!!. He mocks everyone! Including the handicap! His sheep still doesn't see it!🤔. Trump goes after anyone who has class, anyone who is a popular Democratic political figure, anyone who is intelligent and anyone whose name is OBAMA!  Poor unhinged TRUMP possess NONE of these characteristics.. Donald vicious dog trump has released his kennel of  vicious barking dogs, lots of noise, very little bites. Here's why trump will always be the dumbest person in the room. ALWAYS.😎. What the hell is wrong with him??? I felt compassion for him cause his brother died but he makes that impossible to do.. totally unglued...why doesn't someone care about him enough to get him help???. more delusional rants from a man who lives in his own fantasy world. He can say all the crap he wants but it won't change the fact that she has more class in her little pinky than he will ever know.. When you have no facts to back yourself up, you point fingers and blame - it's been the hallmark of his presidency - quite the legacy!!  Ineptitude to the max!. He is always making fun of somebody. He is a bully 😡. Hey diaper Don con we the American people watched while 175,000 America people died while you did your week long photo opts and your weekend golfing. TRUMPERY NO LEADERSHIP.. bully in chief is this so called president and he so does not like anyone smarter then him which most people are. He attacks what he can't be and he can't get close to Michelle's level.. He cares only about himself. Wake up people he shows all of you everyday. You want someone like this for your President. Not me.Vote Blue!. He can never be courgel or just nice the world hates ugliness in every shape or form.  May God give him what he deserves. Now he's going after his predecessor's wife.  He's really losing it.. She has more Class than the present would be occupant. This man has nothing better to do than berate people! Such a little man! He has no business being in the WH!. He is constantly mocking people he can't control.  She is a strong, intelligent woman and she scares him.. Always criticizing someone, never stops! What a hateful human being!. You are the biggest caword and incompetent to ever hold the highest office of the land! Michelle is more educated than your entire corrupt family.. His brother A.K.A 'best friend' just passed away  two day's ago and THAT can't even get him to  forget what an ass he is for 5 minutes and say something nice! An ant has more sympathy for people then he does. He has lost most of his base now. They can’t bear his rubbish.. Maybe Michelle should tell him not to worry about her speech, she’ll send the tape over to Melania 😂. HE ISN'T FIT TO SHINE MICHELLE'S SHOES. AS A SUPPOSED PRESIDENT, HE IS SUPPOSED TO BRING THE NATION TOGETHER. INSTEAD, HE IS GOLFING, LYING, INSULTING PEOPLE HE DOESN'T KNOW, OR PLAYING WITH HIMSELF.. THE MOST IGNORANT PRESIDENT EVER GOING AFTER OBAMA WIFE, SHE IS MUCH MORE EDUCATED THAN YOU AND YOUR FAMILY PUT TOGETHER.. He has a heartfelt hatred for strong women, especially women of color.. Isn't he supposed to be grieving for his brother?. He obsesses over the Obama's!  He'll never measure up to any former presidents, even the very bad ones.....and I thought it couldn't get any more disgusting than Nixon.. Someone slap a straight jacket and handcuffs on the orange menace already. He’s worse than the pandemic.. He just plain hates and is intimidated by strong, intelligent women!. Does he do anything besides mock people?. Someone is running scared so they run their mouth and vomit all over the country 🤮.. He gets more stupid by the day. 🤮. We have her back, but as you all know he can’t touch her.. I am sorry as a supposedly grown man that yOu are still a childish bully!. It really tells you alot when they have top Republicans  speaking at the Democratic convention.. Why in the H do people think this is acceptable behavior from a President??. So tired of this repetitious whining and lying and demeaning of women, just go away January 20th!  Far, far away!. I’d pay a shitload of money to watch a debate between Michelle and Melania!!. I want a decent person as potus. Not someone who committed treason to be placed in the office in the first place. He should be disqualified to run again. ...and the mud=slinging continues.  It is really sad when the negative comments are all you have got.. He makes fun of everyone. Only thing he knows how to do. Certainly can’t lead intelligently..

He is what we are needing.. Victoria Vacher SO TRUE. No empathy or compassion, even for his own family.. Mary HG nothing, he not human he is the devil. Mary HG   Went to the movies when his older brother Freddie passed away.. Anti-Christ. what a piece of crap.  Doesn't even care about his own family.  Only cares about himself.  Even before the country he was sworn to defend.. Condolences to the family. Who may have told the COVID denier that his in and out trip to NY was reported and he can't come back unless he quarantines for 14 days (and masks).just like all citizens who have ill relatives.. so sad for this family!  Cold and evil, one shouldn't be surprised as to what trump, donnie j is.  An empty soul!!  And the saga goes on!!!  I think Mary Trump tried to stop it!. It's so obvious....he cares for no one, no one... not even family... only himself.  That's why he hasn't and never can do anything of value for this country. His only focus is on himself, and those who support him are abetting the destruction of our country.. I thought he said they were close,that his brother was his best friend.. one day that our Criminal President will be behind bars for the rest of his crappy life...and including his family and cabinet members as well.... Bring civility back to the US, it is a great country but it is running into disrepute under this man. He is to the US what King Herod was to babysitting!!!!. Trump is a malignant narcissist. They cannot feel empathy, and see people, everyone as objects to be used  in their favor. Sure, Trump loved his brother as anyone loves a brand new computer or car. When it goes defective... Trump loves no one. Not even himself. His inability to feel love is the root of his personality disorder.. Joe Biden should showed he can put politics aside in a time of family. Joe Biden is a bigger man he put politics aside and did the right thing and sent condolences to Trmup for he's  brothers death.. .....which makes one cringe that his avid supporters have the same mindset. A scary proposition of non-caring and unintelligent.. Sounds like Donald. All about himself.. That should tell his children something.. He said he was his best friend he really doesn’t care about anybody but himself. Nobody is as important as he thinks he is!! He doesn't has no empathy or sympathy.. No one should be surprised....he's right out there, showing the world who and what he is, a VILE individual, less than VERMIN!!!!!. He's a sociopath he didn't care about his brother and he sure as hell doesn't care about America or the American people.. R I P , Robert Trump, I don't know you ,but I probably care more than your brother ,who went to the movies and played golf what a  disgrace he is. Oh but ... Him being there instead of on the golf course wasn't as important as being on the golf course costing the taxpayers more money. The man is focused only on himself!  Completely incapable of thinking of anyone else!  No compassion, no feelings, nothing!  He never disappoints with his low life behaviors!!🤬💩🤮🤬💩🤮. trump is a hollow shell. He has no feelings except for hate, lust and greed. Isn't it good to know that personal tragedy does NOT get in the way of his other pursuits?  What a sleaze!!! 👹. He was afraid that he would get stuck with the funnersl bill. Nothing is surprising regarding this narcissistic sociopath with no conscience or decency. Good night and good luck. Vote Blue  for  two great people of character and kindness, and don’t forget competence.. If that's how he treated the death of his brothers, why do we think it would affect him in any way when almost 170,000 Americans died. NOT HIS RELATIVES OR RICH FRIENDS!!!!!!!. A very lonely,very ill, individual,who should be removed from positions and places so not to endanger himself and others!!. He did visit him.

Golf is his Best friend  any human caring person would never leave the hospital if a family member or close friend were dying. What he cares about...... Nothing  about  this  man  surprises  me  anymore.    He is  completely   devoid of  normal  human  feelings.. When I heard that his brother and best friend had died, I checked the news. Nope! Putin’s still alive.. Sitting at the bedside and offering comfort to your family vs flying off to private resort and playing golf. Priorities are a choice.. Golf,golf,golf. He’s working sooo hard. What’s that costing the taxpayers? Get him out, and take away his money. So then he can play on Public Courses.. Out playing golf with a has been football player, that personally I’ve never heard of, while his brother and best friend is in hospital dying??  That is one heartless Mother!!  🤯. Surprised anyone?   I thought maybe it would slow him down but he has to compete with the Dem convention and make sure he steals the show somehow.   In Mary's book, you see what a rotten, lousy son, brother, friend, whatever, he really is.   What decent person goes golfing when his brother dies?. I cannot imagine my best friend or brother with me close by choosing to golf or go to a movie instead of being there for them as they go through this scary transition. It really defies normal means of behavior.. And cause of death unknown. Bet it's Covid and Trump will make sure it will never be revealed as such. It would make him look bad if his lack of action killed a family member.. So sad to be emotionally alone....no matter how many people are around him he is just in this little   bubble of solitude....kind of like a padded room .... No surprise, he’s an evil monster!. He does not have a single redeeming quality. He is a monster.. Shhh??? He was working hard to spend our hard earned dollars. His hip swing is very important than his dying brother!. I’m not excited about his brother’s death.I will be very excited if it’s the other way around.He said they will see each other again,I wish it will be soon🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. This guy has no soul.. I guess I will play golf when they announce Trump's death: and none too soon!. Melania’s coat Comes to mind . I don’t really care, do you? Not my thought!

877,This is just sickening.,"I believe he is paying Putin by moving troops out of Europe...lifting sanctions, giving him classified information and turning a blind eye to his meddling in elections. As well as paying senate republicans for their cooperation..ie Russians built a plant in McConnell back yard...little insensitive like that to follow the leader. Kathleen Fils well stated. Someone said, a very long time ago I must add, that every time you see Trump do something that seems totally nuts, does not make sense, is not to the benefit of the US, whatever, stop and ask yourself one question -- how does this help Russia?  If it does in fact provide a benefit to Russia, then everything you thought Trump did that was crazy suddenly makes perfect sense.. Dana Ferraro 👍. What is even more sickening is the people who support him really and truly do not care and they will still vote for him....He is a God in their eyes.. Of course he knew about Everyone in government knew.We need to save our country from all the currupt government.We have to bring back our beautiful country back again.That is why we have to vote for Joe Biden. and Kamala Harris, to save our country.God Bless America.. A good amount of trumps wealth comes from Russia, and that was before the election. He has too much to personally lose if he stands up to Putin, so he never does. Such a wimp.. Being swept under the rug  just like all his criminal actions all his life.. a president is informed of every little thing in the world! he knew!and let it happen.for the sake of America,stand up to the con/murderer of Americans/chicken sh** of a man and under-educated wanna-be dictator!. This should be alarming to all Republicans!  Trump works for Putin and loves to play dumb.  If you vote for trump,  you will be living in  communist Russia next year! 💙 💙. Everyone else knew too and they are just as guilty as he is. They are so afraid of losing their well paying jobs and their high rank positions and all the perks that comes with it that they sit back in silence and say nothing. We already know that he c…See More. Just like Covid 19Decapatare him?Stonehim?…See More. Doesn’t matter his base doesn’t care about that even though he had a lot of people killed. He knows 1000/day are dying from Covid, and he sold PPE to Russia.Posimpotusputinoffice. He’s not concerned he’s trying to get re elected. So him and his family of grifters can continue to rape the tax payers and Trash our medical insurance and social services. I wouldn't be surprised if he's getting a kickback on each bounty. That would explain a lot, and be right in character for this heartless conman.. And the entire GOP, in all of their 'ball less' glory elected to ignore it as well.   I guess if it had been a sleeveless dress on FLOTUS Michelle, or POTUS Obama did this, the Senate would have been all over it.  The BIG FLUSH is coming on Nov. 3rd.........Eliminate them all and let's start over with uncorrupted replacements who are actually patriots.. Except numerous US intell agencies,British intell, Israeli intell and at least 2 members of Taliban along with a member of his administration have proven otherwise.. He truly doesn’t care.  Thank you for your services even under these circumstances.. And yet the GOP Senate is not demanding answers. Why?  We should all responsible for it. Our troops are not COLLATERAL DAMAGE.. Of course he knew and his traitorous acts against our military members should not go unpunished.. If a democrat President let this happen do you suppose republicans would still ignore it the way they have?. And that would surprise us....why? It’s typical Trump. Expect the worst from him and he will never let you down. If anything, he’ll astound you with how low he can sink.. This is sickening!! I pray everyday that our sons and daughters are kept out of harms way !! Vote Blue 😡🇺🇸. Wait for malaria to get her I really don’t care coat because neither of them do. He's been a traitor since before he was president, common knowledge...OK now everyone mentally abuse me like normal do you all feel better.... I could not agree more.  Even if Trump himself ignores or does not read his Intelligence Briefings, somebody, somewhere in the chain would have brought his attention to this.  It is too whopping big for the president not to be told, and there are in pe…See More. Of course he knew but just doesn't care for anyone but himself. Blood on tRump's hands and he should be in prison.. Shame on all the cowardly republicans allowing Trump to sell out the U.S. to Russia 😡 How dare they call themselves Americans !. The fear of Putin and greed of his payment is far larger than his feelings for Americans.. I ALMOST DID NOT CLICK ON THIS VBECAUSE I KNEW THE ANSWER, YES HE DID KNOW AND HE IS HAVING POMPEO MEET WITH THE RUSSIANS TRUMP HAD IN THE OVAL OFFICE AFTER THE ELECTION FOLKS JUST DAYS AFTER HE HAD THESE MURDEROUS RUSSIANS IN OUR OVAL OFFICE, WELL YOU KNOW MELANIA AND HER FAMILY ARE COMMUNISTS SO I GUESS RTHEY MAY HAVE COME TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS COMMUISTS WIFE.. I flat out say this bullshit. Everyone around him knew about it. He was afraid to bring it up to Putin. What a joke. Of course he knows.  The question is what did he get for keeping quiet????. He’s participating with Putin in the murdering of American soldiers.. We also know that Putin has something dangerously threatening (quite likely treasonous), hanging over Donnie's head, which is why he's so kiss-butt to everything Russian.. We know, for sure, that Trump knew over a month ago. That’s when he denied knowing sooner. Over a month, and he still has not criticized Russia/Putin for doing it, nor has he come up with a plan to stop it. Despicable!!!. So the so called patriots for Trump don't care. That says a lot about them as well. Shouldn't traitors be subject to death?. How do military veterans support this excuse of a human being???. Why isn't  that enough  for people to vote against  this traitor. The question that both Democrats and Republicans should be asking Trump is “now that you do know (even though there’s proof he did indeed know), what are you going to do about it?” 🦗 🦗.. Of course he knew, Barr said they talked about it!. He sold his soul to Putin to cover his debts. Plus, do you really think he reads his briefings binder?. He knew and did nothing about it. He is afraid of Putin and won't confront him about anything.. He needs to be hounded into an early grave.. If you people who believe this is true and  do nothing  your are guilty as Trump. Well well....he signed policy decisions and then has said...”I don’t know anything about it”🤦🏻‍♀️😡. Please vote Blue ,please vote Blue, try to save our country.. The full headline:Former State Department Officer Said He Knows From Experience That “There Is No Way Trump Could Not Have Known” About Russian Bounties: “He Knew — And He Chose To Do Nothing”. He knows and denies and does nothing about almost everything.... Putin owns Donald. The Steele dossier is all true.. And so does Moscow Mitch!!!!!. Russia has too much on him.  He's not going to go against Putin. Traitor in the WH.  Military should vote blue if they want to save their lives.. In 1980, the US military knew that President Carter was a pacifist  and wouldn't launch a retaliatory strike if the Soviets attacked.   They just hoped the Soviets wouldn't find out..  So a coup was planned for April or May 1981 if Carter was reelected…See More.

Charles Pingel well said. .....OK COMRADE CHARLES!. Voter Suppression is the handlers of #45’s strategy to deflect our fear and concerns about his poor handling of the raging Covid pandemic ‘It is what it is’ #45’s response to Covid☠️When #45 attacks anything in a massive way, it’s always a ‘smoke & mirrors’ deflection from a truth, this one being 170,000 deaths in the US as of today from the pandemic☠️ ‘It is What it is’. ABSOLUTELY  TRUE...WHILE THOUSANDS  OF AMERICANS  ARE DYING..ABSOLUTELY  CRIMINAL  BEHAVIOR... He is a disgrace to America !!! Taking over everything around us    No good Dictator!!!. Makes sense given he has no compassion or empathy for others while at the same time knowing probably prison time is waiting for him.. Jim Wazelle they provided the required ID when they registered. Getting a “proper” Id today is not always easy, or possible, for many. Poor people can’t afford all the fees involved, and in some cases, outright impossible due to regulations that were i…See More. For Trump the Coronavirus, the permanent damage it causes or the deaths are just collateral damage.  I don't believe he cares at all.. Yes, he does not want people to vote. Smaller the number of people vote, he thinks better for him.. Trumptwat is destroying our democracy.  Only he would be so self serving and evil to destroy the post office for his own self interest.. The house the senate the federal courts the us barr the supreme court does nothing while trump continues to destroy America, what a shame!. He needs to be tried for treason when he leave office, just like the Nuremberg trials or Saddam Hussein for trying to strip our country of democracy and walking all over the Constitution!. Isn't that the horrible truth??!. Absolutely 💯 He doesn't care about any of us... Trump  has infringed  more  on  the second  amendment  than  Obama  ever  did  and  now  he’s  done  it  to  the  first  amendment  with  the  attacks  on  peaceful  protesters.  Now he’s  flat  out  attacking  democracy  by  trying to  deny  the  right  to  vote  or  the  ability of  millions of  Americans  to  cast  their  votes.. It is amazing to me how so many righteous people support Trump and his lying, cheating , felonious and misogynistic behavior?. Suppressing the vote has forever been a Republican tactic, but Trump has made it a slap in the face with the Post Office obliteration.. He is hoping the virus will keep people from going to the polls to vote. By stopping the mail-in vote he thinks he will win the election rigged once again. And you are more concerned about politics and should be back in your HOME town helping with all of its problems. Very true.  What gets me is he is either arrogant or stupid for revealing his plan.. Indeed! After all he is only doing what he is capable of doing that is NOTHING!. YES YOU ARE THE  ABSOLUTE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  DONNIE BOY. More people vote less chance of Donald president of Death winning. tRUMP is so stupid, maybe someone in his inner circle should have warn him that even if he won the election fair n square more then half of the population won't  believe it, and then things could become explosive in the usa. Yes he will be glad to serve second term in life prision. Why?  Because he was Black?  You are beyond oblivious to what is going on now and who is leading it.. I agree with you Bob. Now he trying everything he can do is to steal the election. The man is dishonest.. Donald's brother died two days ago. Donald say a thing until we exploded about USPS. He's trying to play the pity card.. Anyone who supports this baboon is a traitor just like trump,. So true, how come no one interferes? This shows once again none of the GOP, besides Mitt Romney, has a backbone and afraid of this traitor. I think it's the Democrats that are trying to rig things.. Ron is right - and DT is already trying to set up the argument that the election was rigged & so he can have a case to try to void it...Trump will be out “by a landslide” but will try anything to keep the Presidency - brace up Americans, Trump’s most blatant ‘scoffing of the law’ could be just around the corner.... Dam right. He all over suppressing the vote but the Corona virus that will magically go away.. 100 times better than the POS in office right now.. Trump has failed like most of his adventures in business will you can mark this one as will. Failed. Or buildings or statues!! Both more important than American lives!!.

And there are still more of them that have killed people and have not been charged, remember the young woman sleeping in her bed and they broke in in the middle of the night killed her, the guy they were after had already been picked up and was in custody plus he lived on the other side of town that's one reason they are still protesting. I guess we could protest that a man with prior felonies and two pending drug related charges had a gun in the first place. :(. They guy wasn’t collecting a taxpayer salary either, nor was his job to “protect and serve.”. Protest that a gun was used to kill him.. Pretty spot on that the dog is smarter than the maga. Put the shoe on the other foot and the same thing can be said about the Police Officer who killed George Floyd.

Erich Schlegel. now do that with george floyd. the racist act like this boys killer was fed BK drivethru on way to police station like that guy who killed many in that church mas killing.. Prexactly.. The bigger issue with this boy being shot and killed is why do the mentally ill have such easy access to guns.. https://www.mediamatters.org/.../list-right-wing....

And as sad as it is to say there are countless people, both blacks and whites, that don’t really want change. They just to bitch and complain. They believe that the world should only revolve around them. And THAT’S why change will never happen. Maybe we should be protesting the idiots who decided another idiot with a gun was a good thing..

Postal workers should donate some time to count votes and make sure ballots are delivered.To save their job from this tyrant. God help us if he is reelected.. trump is taking money out of the postal workers pockets to try to protect him to be re-elected!  It is sad that some Americans cannot see or want to see through his con!  It effects everyone and not just democrats!. Yes Union Strong. Support your postal workers Everyone get out and Vote Blue for Biden and Harris. okay so what say us former postal employees volunteer to count votes just for this election.. That would be GREAT,I'm sure my wife would agree,before Cheetos man fks up and steals all your retirement money,and INSURANCE. There you go a simple way to make the man in the WH go cuckoo. Next is the Republicans in the senate who block the stimulus bill let them go down in defeat this November. As of the house maintain the status quo but get rid of Congressional Republican terrorists.. Its on hold supposedly till after the election. Terrible. I made the call to the senators . Call📞☎️. Many years ago during a mail strike in New York the National Guard was called out to sort the mail!  Is it the Governors who get to call them up? If so let them call up the guard to sort and count the votes!. Joe biden's incapable of being president, the Democrats won him in there so that they can tell him what to do, and then get rid of him.. Thank you Postal Workers! Vote early! Vote blue!!. I still say he only cares about HIMSELF ,greed is a ugly thing to have .. post office been open for a lot of years took baby hurt 3 years to file bankruptcy. Sounds like a plan but you can’t count what hasn’t been delivered because of no overtime or whatever.. Maybe this is a thank you trump, the last straw 😉. The union also did not fail to note the postmaster general’s conflicts of interest and efforts to “kneecap” the postal system, as President Obama referred to them. The Trump administration’s naked power grab will not go unnoticed by voters in November, either. From the article..

They work too. They need help. I think it's great but its just going to piss off Trump more. He is a S##T show!!. Don’t piss off union workers!. He will turn on them. I can’t believe Trump is now removing post boxes in Montana. But Trump and his wife voted by mail in ballots last week. God I despise that man. People are pissed. He’s gotta go.. Oops Henry ended up blocked.....  How did that happen?. Great!. All unions should vote democrat, the only union trump cares about is the police union and that’s only because he backs the bad people in their union. Maybe they should look at themselves why trump backs them. Get movin joe. 2 1/2 months  how many more institutions will he try to destroy?. Buy stamps!. I guess that he'll just fire them all on Monday.. Go for it get trumps ass the hell out of the W H. Looks like the pressure got to the USPS.

990,"Grammatical Genders in different languages of different regions of India Grammatical gender technically means a specific form of noun class system in which the ...division of noun classes forms an agreement system with another aspect of the language, such as adjectives, articles, pronouns, or verbs. We see that in North Indian languages like Hindi and Punjabi - all entities in the world are categorized as either masculine or feminine. Assamese, like Malayalam, has gendered pronouns. Languages like Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada have three categories like Sanskrit for masculine, feminine and neuter genders. Tamil has a unique concept of Thinai where entities are categorized as Uyarthinai and Ahrinai - (Rational and Irrational). Humans, Gods and Demons are Uyarthinai and rest everything is in Ahrinai. The first category has gender associated with it. The second category can be further classified as animate and inanimate (living and non-living) which have further specific word usage. Malayalam, the youngest Dravidian language has no gender in the verbs, however there are gendered pronouns. Telugu is interesting because technically it has the three genders, but in practical usage, there are 2 - masculine and non-masculine. Bengali, Odia, Assamese and most NE languages except for Khasi have no grammatical genders. Mundari languages do not have masculine and feminine differentiation (which is changing due to interaction to other gendered languages) but have a human-nonhuman gender difference.

Nor was indentured labor necessarily cheaper once the considerable recruitment costs were taken into consideration. The key factor may have been that the terms of the indentured contract allowed for much greater control of the labor force. - David Northrup,Duh.

1038,"While working on updating our Learn Socialism Collection today, we made some edits to this graphic for clarity. Hopefully it's more clear than the previous version. #LearnSocialism Image description: The Purchase of People Under capitalism, capitalists purchase amounts of labor from wage-workers. The amount of labor purchased is measured in units of time, usually by the hour. When labor is purchased in units of time, it becomes a special commodity (a good or service) called labor-power. This exchange between capitalists (employers) and wage-workers (employees) creates an illusion: that a worker is even capable of selling their labor or their time separate from themselves in the first place. Hidden behind this illusion is a truth: that a person's labor and time are, in reality, inseparable from their person. [Pictogram: A triangle, with a person at the top corner, a hand holding a wrench (representing labor) at the bottom right corner, and a hand holding a clock (representing time) at the bottom left corner.] This means that with the sale of human labor-power comes the purchase of not only people's labor and time, but also of people. The basic difference between the slave and the wage-worker is this: the slave is sold by another all at once and as a whole, while the wage-worker must sell themselves to one capitalist or another, again and again, hour by hour, piece by piece.","+- 12 hours somewhere. +- 12 hours somewhere.

1040,"Our Lives Are Essential, Capitalism Is Not As the number of infected and deceased increases during this pandemic, we, the working class, continue to pay for the consequences of Capitalism, its ambition and maliciousness. Many governments have refused to enact total quarantines, and those who have, have established all sorts of tricks to ensure the normal functioning of trade and production, forcing us to risk dying from COVID-19, whether through work or hunger, without income... or economic protection to face this crisis and provide for our families. Likewise, we have witnessed the epic image that has been built around health workers, who are really risking their lives to save others, without adequate protection, sufficient personnel, and the equipment necessary to truly combat the pandemic. What they call heroism is precarity; appealing to heroic applause for those who should be able to serve safely. With horror we see how the police and repressive forces that circulate through the streets implementing control over people have these security elements financed by public spending. In other words, the priority is repression and control of the population, instead of taking care of and providing the essentials for life. The working class has to participate in decision-making about this crisis, about who will pay for it, about what measures will be taken in the territories to deal with it, we cannot simply be spectators at this juncture. In turn, the call is to take care of ourselves, to unite in these times of estrangement, to express more solidarity and not let go. Only solidarity and mutual aid will allow us to resist.

1146,"Just so we're all clear -- this is what an assault weapons ban looks like. It would take every bit of political capital the Democrats have built over the last three years, and the only real-world effect would be that you can buy the gun on top, but not the gun below. The basic function of a rifle -- sending a bullet out of a barrel -- is what makes it deadly. Any legislation restricting the features on a rifle will lead to the production of loophole guns that are equally powe...rful but manage to avoid the ""assault weapon"" category. This isn't even getting into the fact that there are *at least* 5-10 million fully-featured AR-15s already in circulation in the United States. So even if a ban were to pass, it would be functionally irrelevant. Image Description: An image displaying two AR-15 platform rifles that are almost exactly the same, save for three small differences. One rifle is labeled “Not an Assault Rifle At All”, the other is labeled “Definitely an Assault Rifle”. At the bottom, an SRA logo and text that reads: “The Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 did not reduce the availability of rifles in the US, nor did it make them any less lethal. In function, the law created an environment where manufacturers produced the same firearms with slightly different features, while artificially inflating the value of pre-ban models.”","One slight problem. There is a difference between assault rifles and assault weapons. An assault rifle is a select fire shoulder weapon chambered in an intermediate cartridge and was already regulated by the NFA as a machine gun before they were even invented. An assault weapon is whatever the fuck liberals in New York and California want to call it in order to make sure citizens can't have good guns.. Putting your focus on arguing semantics vs broadly accepted nomenclature is not going to help anything,. Randall Munro broadly accepted doesn’t mean it’s correct.. Randall Munro except that's not semantics. that's literal legal definition of an assualt rifle. and assualt weapon can literally be anything someone deems scarey. theres no legal definition for it at all. Being incorrect on legal technicalities doesn't help our image much either. Don't act like no reactionary will ever see it, pick it apart, and tell everyone we don't know what we're doing. An assault rifle has an automatic selector switch. It is already banned. That an overlooked technicality here 😆. Marie Cassandra Tristani Trust me you guys are already way ahead of all the people on the pseudo-socialists page(Democratic socialists) lol that place is a fucking joke.. Assault rifles aren't a real thing. Assault rifle is a select fire (implying modes other then semi auto such as full or burst fire) chambered in an intermediate cartridge.  A semi auto rifle is a semi auto rifle no matter if the barrel is threaded, or if there is a bayonet lug or if the magazine is large or small.End of..

Revolutionary actions take time and build up from grassroot action.. bruh.... Peter keeps calling everyone morons which is incredibly ironic.. Imagine thinking the 2nd Amendment was about hunting. Lol. You know what the only distance between a semiautomatic rifle and a pistol is? Effective range and rifles require two hands to shoot and can't be concealed. That's it. Both are equally deadly. Just because you are afraid of the word semiautomatic doesn't mean it's an assault weapon. Pistols are semiautomatic too. Are you gonna ban them too?. Jonathan McCowan the IRA brought no-one to a standstill, the (now threatened due to Brexit!) Good Friday Agreement happened because enough ordinary people from both sides of the divide & the political orgs had seen enough bloodshed from terrorists & the sometimes murderous British army.

1150,"Many — if not most — of the people ICE and CBP target have indigenous roots in the Americas extending back long before European settler arrival and the eventual western expansion of the United States. This reality illuminates the true role these agencies play; the militant arm of a violent settler-colonial project, responsible for targeting indigenous and other “undesirable” populations as our liberal-democratic systems of governance decay into an increasingly reactionary, fa...scist form. In light of the recent news regarding plans for an ICE training facility with “simulations of homes in Chicago and Arizona,” that are so “hyper-realistic” that they include details like “dishes in the sink, toys in the yard,” it becomes clear that ICE is even further militarizing themselves to target communities at home. Rightly alarmed by these developments, more and more people have been asking how they can defend their communities from being torn apart by raids and other anti-immigrant ICE actions.

Rapid Response Networks can use a variety of tactics in response to ICE raids — some send teams to provide legal council, some collect information so families’ loved ones are not lost in the immigration system, some send volunteers with video equipment to film encounters.

1159,"Fred Hampton, Deputy Chairman of the Black Panther Party, was a young revolutionary who did a better job than anyone using materialist analysis to illuminate the common source of all the varying struggles faced by different sub-sections of the working class in the United States. Namely, the inherently exploitative nature of the capitalist mode of production. While Hampton and the BPP were committed Marxists, they did not take a class reductionist point of view. They incorpora...ted race not only in their materialist analysis, but also in their praxis. In 1968, Hampton helped organize the Rainbow Coalition, a multi-racial coalition of street gangs in Chicago, united behind the understanding that racial and ethnic conflict between gangs would only keep its members entrenched in poverty. Hampton was so effective in his work of uniting the proletariat, so threatening to the existing Capitalist economic order, that the FBI decided to murder him in bed, in the middle of the night, during a no-knock raid, as he slept next to his partner. The FBI organized a death squad. And they achieve their goal. Twenty-one years old. 21. The city of Chicago and the federal government ultimately had to pay $1.85 million to families of the deceased (the largest-ever civil rights settlement at the time) because the state’s actions were so egregious. It was an unspeakable loss for the countless people who knew and loved Hampton. But at the same time, as Hampton himself acknowledged: “You can jail revolutionaries, but you can’t jail the revolution… You might murder a freedom fighter… but you can’t murder freedom fighting.” Image Description: Image of Fred Hampton with text: ""I ain't going to die in no airplane.

If you can, please donate to our disaster relief efforts here: MightyCause.com/story/1h9hsf “As Hurricane Dorian is upgraded to a Category 4 storm with potentially devastating impacts, local and national organizations are raising money and preparing for disaster relief for poorer and immigrant communities that may not have the same access to resources before and after natural disasters. And wi...th the added worry of immigration officials targeting some of these communities, organizations are hoping to fill the gaps in distributing food, water and other supplies both before and after a storm hits... In addition to local organizations and volunteers, the Southeast regional chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association — an organization that describes themselves as ‘an educational organization dedicated to providing the working class with the information they need to be effectively armed for self and community defense’ — will be raising money for disaster relief work after Hurricane Dorian hits... Tackett said (their) organization is trying to fill gaps in relief efforts for poor, immigrant and other historically underserved communities, as they may not always receive the same resources or the same urgency from government or non-government agencies and organizations. ‘It is not unheard of, unfortunately, that ICE agents and other federal and state authorities like to camp out in front of these distribution centers, especially those run by established organizations like the Red Cross,’ Tackett said. ‘A big part of what the SRA is trying to do is being able to reach out to these underserved communities who have reason to be concerned about going to even like a Red Cross shelter which, even though that shelter itself might be set up with the best of intentions, it’s being used and exploited by those who have not good intentions.’ The SRA’s fundraiser page can be found at MightyCause.com/story/1h9hsf.”",I'm just baffled as to why some people dont notice the glaring similarities between the US government and that of the Third Reiche....Absolutely floored..

With your help last year we raised $1300 for Hurricane Florence and $3500 for Hurricane Michael. This year we're asking for $5000 for an even larger relief effort under our new SRAid banner (which will be launching independently next year as its own 501(c)(3) charity!) Your donation will be used to purchase food, water, ...blankets, first aid, diapers, menstrual products, and other essential supplies. Our Southeast Disaster Relief Coordinator will stage near Gainesville, GA along with our volunteer members. Depending on when and where the storm makes landfall we will either deliver supplies to emergency shelters before the storm hits, or venture into the affected area after the storm has passed. In either case we will try to make sure our donations are made available to vulnerable and under-served populations that may not be able to rely on FEMA or the Red Cross for assistance. Any donations in excess of what we are able to put towards relief for Hurricane Dorian will be used in future disaster relief efforts, or will be put towards a generator and other improvements for our new disaster relief trailer. The SRA is dedicated to improving community resiliency in the face of climate change and its attendant natural disasters. The work we do for disaster relief today will help us build skills and organizational experience to defend our communities from any danger.  We protect us. We keep us safe.

The organization believes marginalized groups, including people of color and LGBTQ people, should have a space where they can learn how to use firearms to defend themselves.

In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. Even after seven decades, the model and i...ts variants remain one of the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of its reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region, and ease of use.

When you contextualize this murder with the Dayton shooter who killed his brother (a trans man who had recently begun to share their gender identity with trusted friends), and also with the Isla Vista shooting in 2014 carried out by an incel, you see that there is an unmistakable thread of misogyny running through these terror ...attacks.

Other times it emerges in the form of misogynistic incel culture, as is the case with the Dayton and Isla Vista shooters. Regardless of the particular ideological bent, it’s essential that we remain as steadfast and vigilant in our fight against misogyny and transphobia, as we do in our fight against racism and xenophobia. Lives depend on it. Also big ups to Mr. Rafiq. “A 65-year-old man who tackled a gunman who stormed a mosque in Norway is being hailed as a hero. The attacker, who was reportedly wearing a uniform and body armour, broke through a glass door to reach the place of worship, where people were preparing to celebrate the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha. A post on an online messaging board suggested (the shooter) was a far-right extremist inspired by the Christchurch, Poway and El Paso shooters. The same man is also accused of killing his 17-year-old stepsister, whose body was found at her home. ‘We’re investigating this as an attempt at carrying out an act of terrorism,’ assistant chief of police Rune Skjold told a news conference on Sunday. ‘We have uncovered extreme right-wing attitudes.

The 26th of July Movement's name originated from the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks, an army facility in the city of Santiago de Cuba, on 26 July 1953. This attack was led by a young Fidel Castro, who was a legislative candidate in a free ...election that had been cancelled by Batista. The attack had been intended as a rallying cry for the revolution.  Castro was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison but, along with his group, was granted an amnesty after two years following a political campaign on their behalf. Castro travelled to Mexico to reorganize the movement in 1955 with several other exiled revolutionaries (including Raúl Castro, Camilo Cienfuegos, and Juan Almeida Bosque). Their task was to form a disciplined guerrilla force to overthrow Batista. On 2 December 1956, 82 men landed in Cuba, having sailed in the boat Granma from Tuxpan, Veracruz, ready to organize and lead a revolution. The early signs were not good for the movement. They landed in daylight, were attacked by the Cuban Air Force, and suffered numerous casualties. The landing party was split into two and wandered lost for two days, most of their supplies abandoned where they landed. They were also betrayed by their peasant guide in an ambush, which killed more of those who had landed. Batista mistakenly announced Fidel Castro's death at this point. Of the 82 who sailed aboard the Granma, only 12 eventually regrouped in the Sierra Maestra mountain range.  While the revolutionaries were setting up camp in the mountains, ""Civic Resistance"" groups were formulating in the cities, putting pressure on the Batista regime. Many middle-class and professional persons flocked toward Castro and his movement. While in the Sierra Maestra mountains the guerrilla forces attracted hundreds of Cuban volunteers and won several battles against the Cuban Army.  Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was shot in the neck and chest during the fighting, but was not severely injured. (Guevara, who had studied medicine, continued to give first aid to other wounded guerrillas.) This was the opening phase of the war of the Cuban Revolution, which continued for the next two years. It ended in January 1959, after Batista fled Cuba for Dominican Republic, on New Year's Eve when the Movement's forces marched into Havana.
