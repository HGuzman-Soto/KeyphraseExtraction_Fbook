I assume that Jocko will be banging down my door any minute now.... PragerU is funded by oil billionaires, this is blatant propaganda üòÇ. Cole Bell no, it‚Äôs facts. Everything he said was facts.

Dottie Minnich the planet has been around for 7 billion years and has seen many mass extinctions. We are speeding up the process for the next one. This isn‚Äôt a matter of whether the planet will survive, the planet will obviously be fine. It‚Äôs habitability for human life is what‚Äôs coming into question.. Dottie Minnich Literally no scientific source says that. The figure is 4.54 billion, accurate to within 50 million. 7 billion years would make the Earth older than the solar system.. There's a big difference between a threat to the planet itself and a threat to the things living on the planet. And I'm not sure who you think the 'powers that are trying to take over running the USA' are, but when I think about people in the US with too much power, oil billionaires are some of the first people that come to mind, and they're the ones telling you not to worry about climate change.. Shawn Lada - I'd rather not look at AOC.

No seriously, I give you credit for admitting where you were wrong once, but you gotta do it quite a bit more because, well, you're dead wrong. Sandy? Wtf. If you want to know what a couple of fracking billionaires think of the Green New Deal, I suppose watch. But at least know who pays for PragerU's funding.. David Wright or anyone with common sense or knowledge on energy productionü§∑üèª_‚ôÇÔ∏è.... Bruh, you‚Äôre bankrolled by the fracking industry.This is widely available information.. This video goes to prove that the 'smart' and 'highly educated' are infact, not.. Kyle Egelhoff Im literally talking about solar panels being good. I mentioned solar batteries becuase solar panels can have batteries connected to them so they have extra charge for when the sun isn't shining- becuase the video completly ignored the fact that the power generated by solar panels could be stored and used later.. Your house runs on AC current not DC current. You can not store AC current in batteries. The energy in the powerlines are AC because it can travel farther then DC before losing energy. Yes it can be converted between the two, but there is always a loss‚Ä¶See More. Solar panels currently power american homes, I don't know why you are talking about solar panels like they are some impossible dream. This page is literally sponsored by the Koch brothers and other oil barons. PLEASE do your own research and don't trust these grifters.. NO GREEN DEAL..PERIOD... Betty Nana good to see you're keeping an open mind.. Betty Nana which one are you in the photo, the lady with the white hair in the center?. 'The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels' LMAO. Just so everyone knows, most of PragerU's early funding came from Dan and Farris Wilkes. Two brothers who started a fracking company. There is a reason PragerU shills for the fossil fuel industry.. Prager U would support hitler as long as he used fossil fuels at Aushwitz. We don't cotton to folks of the Epstein ilk round these parts no more, take yourself out SIR. bah!  Within ten years we'll be 100 percent wind, and solar!  Ray Kurzweil said so.. Our beaches are eroding and we have lost lots of island nations do to the rising water and sea levels. Aren't yall funded by the Koch Brothers lmao.. The deal with the green new deal is Prager has his head up his ass.. PragerU is funded by fossil fuel billionaires the Wilks brothers. Are you telling me a person whose entire funding is based on fossil fuels is against a plan that moves away from fossil fuels?. The fact that he said nuclear energy is the safest form of energy is actually hilarious I guess they don't know about Chernobyl incident and how it was one of the worst nuclear disaster in human history or how fossil fuels are a leading cause of global‚Ä¶See More.

Oscar Wilhelmy nuclear energy is dangerous it could literally destroy a whole country or a city. It bothers me how people's entire perception of nuclear energy is based primarily on the failures of two or three specific locations: Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011), and Three Mile Island (1979, if you're in the US). France's energy grid is around ‚Ä¶See More. This is how you know Prager is a toxic sellout media outlet!. What ‚Äúmoral case‚Äù for fossil fuels? There is no moral case for fossil fuels. Any relation to the other Epstein?. There are many scientists that don't agree. This is about Obama billions of dollars inestments and all  crap going on today.. They aren't even an educational institute. I see that oil money is being put to good use by ya'll eh?. Some talking head paid by the oil lobby, man I'm so interested on his thoughts on Greene energy and fossil fuels! I can imagine they align with, fossil fuel good green energy bad, even though it's a growing industry. How are you going to power New York City? 10billion wind turbines?! Store the energy in a battery the size of a building?  Nuclear is the future folks!. WE ARE ALREADY  USING RECYCLED MATERIALS FROM THE EARTH THAT WORK PRETTY WELL!. If oil companies are so profitable, why do they STILL need to be subsidized? China is going to be ahead of us because they're moving to better sources of energy faster, while the oil companies in the US fund idiots like  Prager U to spread propaganda and  keep them in business, so they won't have to keep up with the times. They profit short-term, the entire country loses in the long term.. PragerU is not a real university.. Hey all you believe green new deal so much. How many of you want to chip and buy me a Cyber truck. Otherwise im gunna need gas still. I'm just impressed by the mental gymnastics and rhetorical tapdancing on display here. Well, that and this dude's perpetual constipated look.. funny how i see this video just as there‚Äôs floods in mexico, texas, china, and india .... the earth is getting tired of our bullshit. because of people like this we‚Äôre all going to go extinct.. Shilling for the destruction of our planet and extinction of ours and many other species, anything for the almighty dollar, your one true god right?. Hey Prager U where'd'ja get the money for this video?. So CO2 is the reason for longer life expectancy and not modern medicine and a deeper understanding of modern science ü§î seems legit.. Oil companies have time and money to transition into clean energy companies, but they're not going to do that until they sell every drop of oil!. You never know. There was an oil billionaire who said, 'We didn't leave the stone age because we ran out of stone' so there's definitely some trying to get the jump.. You almost have to respect PragerU for this video. Most right wing media propaganda will tell you that rise in co2 levels are a hoax or something like that. But they lean into it. Not only are they rising but that‚Äôs good. It makes ‚Äúglobal greening.‚Äù Don‚Äôt worry about where Florida went, now we grow corn at the North Pole. You win some you lose some.. Daniel Podesta the best lies contain some truth in them.. C'mon, commenters. Do you really think the fracking billionaire-funded organization is intentionally trying to mislead the public? It's not like this is part of a consistent misinformation campaign spearheaded by the very people falsely claiming to be climate experts.Oh wait... https:''features.weather.com'course-climate-misinformation'. In these times when the American right is actually gaining credibility and making intellectually sound arguments against the crazed out left, the right's denial on climate brings all of that credibility back down. We should stop listening to people who take a narrative driven stance, right or left. Listen to people who consistently take a data driven stance. Data = truth.. The data is that Solar and Wind is ineffective and wastes more materials and kills more wildlife respectively.The data is that The Green New Deal has nothing to do with conserving the Environment.. https:''youtu.be'1zrejG-WI3U. Climate deniers are stupid mfers.. A lot of people on here informing us that Prager is funded by oil lobbiests, but no one providing information on why the information is false.. Valerie Cihak I didnt even watch the video and I can summarize it for you. Either they are claiming the science isnt there to prove C02 has an impact on the warming of the earth or humans aren't as responsible for it. Either way it's just propaganda. Conservatives and Libertarians are too goddamned stupid to fact check anything, and expect others to provide them with information they're not interested in, and will refuse to believe no matter how well documented the facts are.. Love getting information from a dude who wrote for the Ayn Rand Institute and was funded by the Koch brothers speaking in a video by a right wing think tank that is funded by fracking billionaires and exists solely to spew corporate propaganda üëçüèª. https:''www.youtube.com'watch?v=VxWYglbtqnQ. Elijah White No one's saying that the world is *literally* going to end in 12 years.The more salient point is that we have a 12 year window to prevent a large amount of warming that will cost us a significant amount of money over the next 100 years.. Idk why everyone thinks this is a great idea this is why so many states always vote red because everytime democrats get in a lot of republicans lose their jobs without a new job in site they should really add the jobs first then start the process of moving people to the new jobs or red will continue to vote red for not only that reason but several more. Lmao why do y'all wanna fight so hard for shitty coal jobs? If you put half that energy into moving forward we'd be much closer to a world of plenty.. Good to see a majority of people don't buy into Prager's bullshit--literal propaganda machine based on nothing but common ignorance's ability to believe whatever pops up on the news feed.. 'Thank you oil daddies for all the oil money! we'll be sure to bash anything close to reigning in your blood thirsty practices'- PragerU. Currently 66 very clueless, or very stupid people laughing at this. He is 100% correct. I work in the energy industry, and I know what it entails. It‚Äôs not as simple as so many brainwashed people think it is. And the climate ‚Äúthreat‚Äù leftists keep talking about is next to nothing - it‚Äôs a manufactured crisis just like every other corrupt Leftist cause.. Shannon Wagner Agenda 21. What about hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and nuclear power? Wind and solar are only 2 options.. Ryan Hathaway it framed the comment about 'no country being even 50%' and led the audience the believe that meant renewable. Two countries have reached 100% renewable but they didn't EXCLUSIVELY use wind and solar. It's just short of being a lie.. Nuclear, geothermal, geomagnetic. You missed a few green energies. Ryan Kish did you actually watch the video? He clearly talks about Nuclear energy and it's part.. Matt Clodfelter meant more towards thorium should have been little more specific. This comment section gave me a tiny smidgen of hope!. Nice try, Epstein.

It‚Äôs not defacing the flag.  It would have to be an American flag to be defacing it.  It is not an American flag.  If you want to talk about disrespecting the flag - driving around wit a flag on your truck - when the flag is shredding- that is disredpectful. Jeremy Bigford that is fine - but when they are torn or ripped'shredded that is disrespectsble. Just call them at 2am when a guy tries to come in your house and see how long it takes the cops to get there. Sad truth is that they will come but they come to call a clean up crew or take someone's statement. The only one protecting you is you! I'm not saying we don't need cops but saying that they always protect you is nonsense.. Thomas Geissler so true.

Whoever wrote 5606 I think I know who you are talking about because they dined and dashed on me because I was against the revolution. I was friends with these two girls and one guy freshman year. They asked me what my parents did and I said they both were nurses, and that I was on financial aid. Mind you, my mom is a school nurse and makes nowhere near the amount of hospital nurses.  From then on, they began treating me differently. Suddenly they would hang out without ...me and I know they should talk a lot of shit about how I was rich. One day I ran out of money on my metrocard downtown in a station where there were no machines. I asked if I could borrow a swipe and I would repay them for it. I was cursed out on the middle of the platform because it was apparently rude to offer them money just because they were poor. I didn't understand why it was rude because I would have given anyone the 2.75 and knew nothing about his financial situation. When I said that he told me to stop lying and refused to speak to me on the entire ride home.  A few weeks later, we all went to an all you can eat sushi place in Queens and I was really excited. We went and ate a bunch because it was pretty pricy (like 40 bucks a person) plus some of us got beers too. Both of my female friends decided to go to the bathroom and then I was alone with my guy friend. Things were still weird between us and after a few minutes, he said he was going to check on our other friends. When I offered to go with him, he said I shouldn't because the wait staff needed to know that we didn't dine and dash. So he left and then I was alone at the table to only find out that they all dined and dashed me.  They texted me that they left me with the bill because of how mad my male friend was as a result of the metrocard thing. They mentioned something about how my actions showed that I was against the revolution. I shit you not paying someone back in their minds is anti-communist. It literally made no sense. I tried paying the entire bill which was well over 200 with tip and tax, but my card only had around 80 dollars on it because I had paid for a textbook earlier that day. I had to wait an hour and a half in the restaurant sobbing until my parents could come down from New Jersey and give me the rest of the money. One of them had the audacity to wish me a happy birthday the next week.  I've heard from other people on campus that they've done this kind of stuff to them too. They're fully a group of uneducated people who think they're swindling the rich by actually fucking over their peers, who aren't even wealth. I didn't think people actually did this crap before it happened to me, but apparently they do.","Yo is this real ?. Nigel Telman.

So hopefully I should be able to avoid this.. Jebadiah Stonewall Bacon - push your LO and processor you get you closed and funded by the end of the month!. You should be good.  If you're just doing a regular refi and have no issues with your paperwork, it shouldn't take more than two weeks to close.. So glad my refinance literally finished today and is being funded on Monday..... I got mine approved last month, thank goodness. Bummer. I was planning on refinancing in the near future. Luckily this will not be a huge barrier for me but it will definitely give me a reason to reconsider moving forward with refinancing.. You already have to pay closing costs when you refinance.. Refinancing for cash out and paying off high interest debt  is also a no win situation with IRS tax laws changed under quiet tax reforms of three years ago.. ‚ÄúAnd they say banks and other lenders are making record profits on refinanced loans, so they don't necessarily have to pass along the added cost to homeowners.‚ÄùThat is hysterical.. Keith Esterly it's not a bug of capitalism, it's a feature.. So don't refinance. Even without the new fee, it takes years to make up the other fees that they always charged, even with a lower rate. Just keep plugging away at the original mortgage.. Debbie Fromer We‚Äôre saving $600 a month by refinancing because rates have changed so, so much since we bought our house. It will take less than 2 years to recoup the cost of the refinance, which was rolled into the loan anyway so we only have to worry about that if we sell in the next 2 years. It can absolutely be worth it.. Debbie Fromer silly you. Are that figures into the spread. You seem like you really don‚Äôt understand simple finance. Spread is what your current all in cost is vs what your new all in cost is. I hate to think you believe yourself capable to advise people on refi.. Debbie Fromer Some people have no other choice right now.. Debbie Fromer I get the feeling you don't really know what you're talking about.. The rates are so low that refinancing helps those who need it the most (by lowering their payments). Refinancing actually makes it more likely they won't need to default, so the reasoning is crap.. Yeah that's not helpful if you already did lol. Debbie Fromer May or may not have been a great deal, but I chose a higher interest rate than offered in order to have the lender credits to cover all closing costs.  I wanted to be ahead from day one.. Debbie Fromer   Why aren‚Äôt the red blooded Mercans with their 2A righteousness not out shooting Mitch an The Donald and anyone else standing in the way of Freedumb ?. Joe Dufour, plus the other bank charges. The $1500 is only one of them.. Mikel Podgursky McLaughlin, what does ‚Äúwalked away with $500 at closing mean?‚Äú Does that mean you only paid $500 in fees to refinance?. not always true....depends on how old the loan is and the rate;. Yes, I shouldnt cut my term nor my rate in half because you told me so. What you're saying is misleading.  It greatly depends on what rate you're paying versus what your new rate will be.  And if you're refi'ing with a trustworthy company, they'll let you know if its worth it financially.  I refi'd last month and went from‚Ä¶See More. as a loan officer...this sucks, but i understand it's because they are expecting lots of foreclosures soon...... So don't let people lower their payments so they might be able to avoid default? Makes total sense üôÑ. Govt supported company raises fees during a pandemic...nothing more American that this.. Well that should be cut into the housing market.. Marty Birch , only on refi‚Äôs.. Marty Birch not if you read the article.. ‚Äúall home mortgages that are refinanced‚Äù. Refinance your car first. My interest went down 1.25% by switching to a local credit union. Plus, the process pushed a payment back a month which means a lot to us ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù.. Such a crock. We‚Äôre not making enough off of you for doing nothing, so if you try to cut into our income, we will find you and charge you. Meanwhile, as your bank, we will provide less service to you as we strive to be more efficient to our shareholder‚Ä¶See More. Now is the time to help ppl, not attach more fees to something they're already paying for. Mortgage Rate down,so they get  money from you , another way. I am so thankful I don‚Äôt have a Mortgage anymore.. It's all for profits. It always has been.. Sounds more like a prepayment penalty....what BS. Aside: are homeowners who are in the market to refinance right now really the people who need relief the most?. Kenny Satterlee it was with the current lender. Carl Beutler  yes!. Carl Beutler refinancing isn‚Äôt relief.. Keith Esterly it can be relief if their payments drop a few hundred dollars.... a matter of individual perspective. Carl Beutler The fee wasn't charged until now.. Ilana Weisel I would say it‚Äôs arguably one of the best parts of Obama‚Äôs TARP initiative were modifications! I hope it worked out for you!. Big deal. Over the life of a 15-30 year mortgage, this fee is a drop in the hat when you actually consider the difference paid between a 4 or 5% interest rate vs. a 2.5 or 3% interest rate.Refinance. While you're at it, refinance to a 15 year.. Kristin Schultz The fee is often required to be paid up front when refinancing. That can be thousands in cash that many people simply don‚Äôt have right now.. Thanks Trump.  You pick only the best people.. So if you have excess money and dont neex a refinance....theyll refinance you. One more knife in the back of the middle and lower class. That's really not that bad considering... even so, I would challenge it in court if it isnt explicitly in the contract. Brian McCarten yeah üëè. Considering what?. Considering most of the country doesnt own a 300,000 house and even if they did 1,500 isnt that much compared to the money saved on the life of the mortgage.... ‚Äú.... Trump administration-appointed regulators at the Federal Housing Finance Agency who approved the new fee.‚Äù. Mari Mari yep, no surprise. Leave it to Trump!. Dang!  Looks like we refi'd just in time!  Closed about a month ago.  Got a nice 2.99 on a 30-year.. Can anyone explain why they aren't saying '.5 % of the loan' and are saying 'half of 1 %'?. Average Americans don't math.. Mark Flanagan false. Please try again.. Nate Sullivan trish better not bump this into September!. Sam Cruz Jr. Will this happen to me?. Matt Grieger. David Bannister. Cammy Donnen. Laura Mast. Sounds like my fee may be around $600? If I did the math correctly?. Jimena Rojas Amurrio something to think about. Let Flor know.. Matthew Fante-Becker. Helen Amodio do you know anything about this?. Closed on Monday and got funds today.   Phew.  Debt consolidation and lower interest rate made this worthwhile.. Welp they're predicting a catastrophe.

Don't you even question me about R. That's not even a real language, it's just for bio majors to pretend like they know a thing or two about statistics. Its variable assignment operator is an abomination; its syntax is as if a middle schooler decided then and there that they wanted to create a new programming language. I mean seriously, using x <- 5 rather than x = 5? You're even worse than JavaScript! And I'm going to flip my shit if you bring up MATLAB.

I'm tired as shit about the computer fans whizzing every 5 minutes while I try to run this thing. I don't give a fuck about all your cool packages with remote-control cars or machine learning - the python packages are simply superior.

UPDATE, comrade is looking to get access to now an updated 2K: 1696.13/2000$ Previous: 150/100$ Hey comrades!!! ^^  A Black comrade of mine is in urgent need of mutual aid in order to help survive the persistent violent conditions of antiBlackness and capital. This aid is urgent. Its urgent not only because in the abstract it would help secure matierals which are nessecary for life for my comrade (food, water, transportation, etc), but also more trenchantly, because this aid is nessecary in order to support their continual resistance to the genocidal conditions of antiBlack violence which are constantly conferred onto them. AntiBlackness accumulates matierality for white and/or non-Black people through exporting gratutious violence against Blackness. This means for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, the matierality that we have (regardless of how much) is indivisibly tied to the rendering fungible, dispossession, and eradication of Blackness that is integral to the antagonism of antiBlackness. Given this, and as one small piece in the larger nessecary commitment to aiding Black liberation, it means that for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, we must redistribute the matierality that we have back to Black people by any means nessecary!!! My comrade is in need, so lets get to this!!!

Education is essential. Schools are not. Teachers did not sign on to risk their lives. Nurses signed on to save lives at all costs, even a risk to their own. No comparison. We shouldn't be exposing nurses to unnecessary risk, either.That said, people are in hospitals to save their lives. Grouping people in schools endangers their lives. It isn't worth the risk to anyone.. Saddle Rivera I agree. I know that feeling of unknown these teachers and children are going into. They shouldn‚Äôt be forced to..

Aaron Mikey , off course not. Look, this is a personal attention seeking story of two people who want a reality show. Does it even make sense that a nurse who is supposed to be overwhelmed has time to write this, and that a nurse would promote an action that would cause the healthcare units to overload?. Lisa Anna  not true. Nurses were instructed annually in disaster preparation, including adequate PPE & government led response.. Sherisse McLaurin exactly.

I'll see one prescreened child at a time, by appointment only, in a completely sterile environment, in full scrubs for 10-15 min then send them home. And the parents can come too, be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it's their turn. I'll see 15 children a day.. So many wonderful people in healthcare. And then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with. They think the whole workforce is to meet their standard. There are many occupations that deserve equal respect‚Ä¶See More. Saddle Rivera When DJT‚Äôs kid goes back to school & when he opens back up the White House then we‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs safe!.

James Troutman, I honestly think he'd make his kid go to school like his buddy Putin had his daughter take a 2nd Phase Covid Vaccine. Btw, did Trump's younger brother just die of Covid after Trump had him take the hydroxychloroquine. Just thinkin. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Nick LaCerva she probably doesn't care... Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. üëç... this is just a Trumpie ...NTY gives space to Cotton, Newsweek to that old lawyer and The Atlantic to this nurse .... SAME ..... I‚Äôve been a teacher, healthcare worker now.Stop giving nurses so much attention üòé. Jacki Webb üíØ%. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Andrew Hsieh this. üíØ. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.   If it  is  not  safe  for  football,  theaters,  and  innperson in person meetings,  kids  do  not  need  to  go  to in  person  school.. Angie Johnson Krivchenia True. But the administration wants the economy back rather than safety from COVID. 'It is what it is...' Trump.. So I have been a nurse for over 40 years, still working in a hospital. I know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe.  Teachers are educators and don't need to put their safety at risk and be exposed to Covid, period. Teachers shoul‚Ä¶See More. It's not their work, it's who they work with. Kids and families and all the other people out of the house because schools are open (so parents can work) and in risk of infection. A nurse just stays in hospital waiting for sick people to go to them. Even in lockdown.. I guess that nurse wants to keep ‚Äúdoing her job‚Äù because kids going to school is going to make more sick patients.. Also, that‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve heard.. I kinda feel sorry for her husband.. The difference is that Nurses save lives when they show up to work. Teachers coming in will cause more people to end up at the hospital. How does that help you, Nurse?. You chose healthcare and the potential risk that came with it. Teachers chose education and the lower risk of being exposed to kids with sniffles. Big difference.. Said what I said... this is a cold human being PERIOD. Cant compare nurses with teachers. THATS the point..... Hess Reunion umm I never attended the university of Phoenix. I have a masters in special education and a license in elementary, alternative and secondary social studies. What‚Äôs your point.. Hess Reunion and I‚Äôm a NP.....I‚Äôd also like to know your point?. Anthony Jason Warren I don‚Äôt disagree. At least they are only having brief interactions...but still.. Leigh Taylor haters are gonna hate... Let‚Äôs pay teachers what nurses and doctors make first, and then we can have this discussion. Also let‚Äôs make sure teachers have other staff to do all the cleaning too, and then again, we can have that discussion.. Hardly, there is liability in every job and because of that, you get trained to deal with that liability. People who choose to work in 'dangerous' professions, know what they are signing up for when they enrolled in school. Teaching is not meant to be ‚Ä¶See More. Schools are not funded like hospitals.  Ours is not air-conditioned, with poor air circulation, no way to social distance and in a small space for 7 hours I a day with little kids who may or may not be wearing a mask. Nurses keep people alive. In person school isn't worth anyone's life. Not teachers ', not students', not parents', not grandparents'.. As a nurse, people rely on you to help them get better when they're sick. In other words: if you don't do your job, they might die and they have to see you in person in order for you to help them. You cannot treat people for Covid-19 remotely.As a tea‚Ä¶See More. Bullshit. The kids aren't in going to school because their lives are in danger. In fact, going to school can and WILL put their lives at risk, and especially the teachers. The teachers' efforts aren't saving the lives of their students.Also... PPE...‚Ä¶See More. and just in case anyone thinks kids aren't at risk, we've already had multiple outbreaks around the country because of KIDS! Kids going to camp, kids going back to school, kids doing sports... This is the most absurd argument for public health I've ever heard in my life!. And patients aren't grouped together in one room. Can you imagine having 20 patients in one room and trying to keep them from being exposed to each other.  And kids aren't in bed they're up running around. There is no comparison.. They should be given the proper tools to do their job. Historically, this has not happened.. The Atlantic we‚Äôre in the midst of a public health emergency and y‚Äôall look like clowns publishing this opinion-based nonsense. signed, a covid icu nurse who doesn‚Äôt want to risk unnecessary exposure for teachers and families. See the thing is, she *chose* the healthcare field knowing the risk of exposure to communicable diseases; teachers chose the field of education to *educate* people.  The thing about opinions is that they are like assholes...everybody has one...and some actually *are* one.  Let me guess...she‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúnurses‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt believe in vaccines and has an essential oil for everything üôÑ.

Ron it is the comment section after all ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è. ...wtf, so everyone needs to expose themselves to the risk of sacrificing themselves or family members for the good of the masses?. Teachers can teach remotely. Nurses generally need to be in the company of patients.. No. Health care workers agreed to work in health care. Teachers did not.. So you, as a nurse, can be overwhelmed again? Logic? You do realize nothing about the virus has changed, right?. a teachers job is not to put their lives on the line bc a country doesn't have adequate familial support to allow people to quit their jobs and shelter in their house with their families. jesus america is scary. The issue is not only are teachers and other staff ‚Äîand their families-exposed to a potentially deadly illnesss but so are schoolchildren‚Äîand their families.  And anyone who comes into contact with them.  What the nation needs now is a nation wide stay‚Ä¶See More. I don't want my kids to go to school. I'll deal with the distance learning. Schools can't seem to manage bullying. Imagine bullying by exposing kids to Covid? Teachers can teach through Zoom ... Protect themselves as well ... & I am a healthcare worker. How many nurses, doctors and staff died? People have to go to hospitals. Kids don't have to go to a building in a crowd and become little carriers.. Can a nurse do their job remotely? Regrettably, no. There are jobs that most be done in person.Teaching can be done online. ‚ÄúYou gotta do it because I had to do it.‚Äù is lazy thinking.. I signed up to teach kids. A nurse signs up to work with sick people.

essential schools are not teachers did not sign on to risk their lives nurses signed on to save lives at all costs even a risk to their own no comparison we should not be exposing nurses to unnecessary risk either that said people are in hospitals to save their lives grouping people in schools endangers their lives it is not worth the risk to anyone saddle rivera i agree i know that feeling of unknown these teachers and children are going into they should not be forced to aaron mikey as a nurse myself i could not agree with her more aaron mikey a nurse has proper ppe teachers do not nurses have training on how to handle infectious diseases teachers do not lisa anna i think they repost bc they know it is controversial and people will argue resulting in clicks and comments also having teachers not go into schools is more likely to save nurse lives she is literally making her job harder lisa anna i agree lisa anna also lets talk about compensating like an essential worker lisa the socialization conflict resolution brain storming teamwork development and physical development kids get in school is something they will not get sitting in front of a computer aaron mikey off course not look this is a personal attention seeking story of two people who want a reality show does it even make sense that a nurse who is supposed to be overwhelmed has time to write this and that a nurse would promote an action that would cause the healthcare units to overload lisa anna not true nurses were instructed annually in disaster preparation including adequate ppe government led response sherisse mclaurin exactly i am so tired of the hero teacher narrative i teach science to high schoolers i can do that adequately without them physically being present my students are old enough to stay home alone if necessary so i do not even provide daycare while i manda linn amen we have heard the hero narrative for weeks with my districts reopening push and then saying that we cannot call ourselves heroes if we refuse to get back in the classroom sick of it great i will see one prescreened child at a time by appointment only in a completely sterile environment in full scrubs for 10 15 min then send them home and the parents can come too be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it is their turn i will see 15 children a day so many wonderful people in healthcare and then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with they think the whole workforce is to meet their standard there are many occupations that deserve equal saddle rivera when djts kid goes back to school when he opens back up the white house then we will know that it is safe i whole heartedly agree as an rn for 40 years this article made me both sad and angry this is not a way to promote public heath or support parents in such hard times this nation has let down both its nurses and its teachers along with every james troutman i honestly think he would make his kid go to school like his buddy putin had his daughter take a 2nd phase covid vaccine btw did trumps younger brother just die of covid after trump had him take the hydroxychloroquine just thinkin does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus is not her job to stop the virus and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite nick lacerva she probably does not care teachers never stopped doing their jobs and their jobs can be done virtually if funded accordingly a teachers job is not to maintain public health the government failed everyone here with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school teachers and schools included this is just a trumpie nty gives space to cotton newsweek to that old lawyer and the atlantic to this nurse same i have been a teacher healthcare worker now stop giving nurses so much attention jacki webb nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic in places that have rapid community spread and do not have resources for adequate precautions i e most of the country teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic andrew hsieh this children on the other hand are not essential workers there is absolutely no need to endanger their lives for the economy if it is not safe for football theaters and innperson in person meetings kids do not need to go to in person school angie johnson krivchenia true but the administration wants the economy back rather than safety from covid it is what it is trump so i have been a nurse for over 40 years still working in a hospital i know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe teachers are educators and do not need to put their safety at risk and be exposed to covid period teachers it is not their work it is who they work with kids and families and all the other people out of the house because schools are open so parents can work and in risk of infection a nurse just stays in hospital waiting for sick people to go to them even in lockdown i guess that nurse wants to keep doing her job because kids going to school is going to make more sick patients also that is the dumbest thing i have heard i kinda feel sorry for her husband the difference is that nurses save lives when they show up to work teachers coming in will cause more people to end up at the hospital how does that help you nurse you chose healthcare and the potential risk that came with it teachers chose education and the lower risk of being exposed to kids with sniffles big difference said what i said this is a cold human being period cant compare nurses with teachers thats the point hess reunion umm i never attended the university of phoenix i have a masters in special education and a license in elementary alternative and secondary social studies what is your point hess reunion and i am a np i would also like to know your point anthony jason warren i do not disagree at least they are only having brief interactions but still leigh taylor haters are gonna hate let us pay teachers what nurses and doctors make first and then we can have this discussion also let us make sure teachers have other staff to do all the cleaning too and then again we can have that discussion hardly there is liability in every job and because of that you get trained to deal with that liability people who choose to work in dangerous professions know what they are signing up for when they enrolled in school teaching is not meant to be schools are not funded like hospitals ours is not air conditioned with poor air circulation no way to social distance and in a small space for 7 hours i a day with little kids who may or may not be wearing a mask nurses keep people alive in person school is not worth anyones life not teachers not students not parents not grandparents as a nurse people rely on you to help them get better when they are sick in other words if you do not do your job they might die and they have to see you in person in order for you to help them you cannot treat people for covid 19 remotely as a bullshit the kids are not in going to school because their lives are in danger in fact going to school can and will put their lives at risk and especially the teachers the teachers efforts are not saving the lives of their students also ppe and just in case anyone thinks kids are not at risk we have already had multiple outbreaks around the country because of kids kids going to camp kids going back to school kids doing sports this is the most absurd argument for public health i have ever heard in my life and patients are not grouped together in one room can you imagine having 20 patients in one room and trying to keep them from being exposed to each other and kids are not in bed they are up running around there is no comparison they should be given the proper tools to do their job historically this has not happened the atlantic we are in the midst of a public health emergency and you all look like clowns publishing this opinion based nonsense signed a covid icu nurse who does not want to risk unnecessary exposure for teachers and families see the thing is she chose the healthcare field knowing the risk of exposure to communicable diseases teachers chose the field of education to educate people the thing about opinions is that they are like assholes everybody has one and some actually are one let me guess she is one of those nurses that does not believe in vaccines and has an essential oil for everything kristin humbles so by her mis logic i would be led to assume that nurse who care for children who are hospitalized also teach whatever lessons their

Pendley has faced criticism for past statements in support of selling off federal public land.,"his nominees are always the antithesis of what they are charged to oversee and protect.  Always.. Catherine, that‚Äôs his idea, destroy from Within.  DeVos is a clear example.. Destructionists. yep, look at Dejoy and Devos.. Jerry JB I agree Jerry. It‚Äôs going to take a long time to undo the damage, if that‚Äôs possible. I was an NRA member and took Hunter Safety courses. Now it‚Äôs all about the Benjamins. Pretty sad.. Catherine Howard exactly. Yes. I wonder why only this time, the criticism caused a withdrawal.. Catherine Howard Deconstruction is still the plan.. Jerry JB completely agree.. TRUE!! In fact...they are there to DESTROY  what their in charge of!! Every one of them!!. Justin Parton true that.. Catherine Howard That's a fact! He is evil!. Catherine Howard ALWAYS. Well said. Catherine Howard absolutely true. And his idea of protect means: make money off of.... Justin Parton Correct, hunting and hunters fund a large portion of conservation efforts.  Not all hunters are crazy MAGA 2nd Amendment nuts.  For a lot of people in this country, hunting is an important tradition and equates to spending time with and learning from family.  As long as you‚Äôre responsible and respectful, hunting can be seen as more respectable than just buying slaughter house fodder.. Catherine Howard   always. Catherine Howard It‚Äôs almost like him and his followers hate America.. Jerry JB I have yet to meet ANYONE who didn't have an ancestor who was a hunter. I'm 67 years old. Well, if you break an agency, you can say that it doesn't work and sunset it.. Catherine Howard So true.. Catherine Howard exactly!!!. Catherine Howard Yeah. Like getring one of the most ignorant people he knows to run the Department of Education. What's up with that? Those are the 'very best people' he pledged to help run his administration? Really?. Catherine Howard Cruella DeVilles every one.. Catherine Howard exactly.. Catherine Howard I‚Äôm waiting for him to appoint Farmer John to head the Union of Orthodox Rabbis.. Catherine Howard That is the plan of this administration, to dismantle all the departments and destroy the U.S. as we know it.  That‚Äôs why all the wolves are put in charge of the hen houses.. This is good news but may just mean that he‚Äôs knows he won‚Äôt get approved. Pendley is already acting director so my guess is Trump will keep him on till the end of his term to do as many evil deeds as possible.. Daniel Collay it‚Äôs political theater. Odds are good Trump will lose, so what‚Äôs the point of filling a post for a few months at best?. Which just means he has found someone equally unqualified.. Or worse.. Barbara Havens Joe Exotic?. All public lands and the natural resources therein should first supplement old age pension and public healthcare.  And held in perpeturity  for this purpose.. John Kimball Great idea, try getting current politicians to do it!. This is a start, but he must be REMOVED, and not allowed to remain as acting director. Tell your elected representatives.. Raising hell MATTERS! Keep marching, keep contacting elected officials!. Selling off our federal lands would be a huge mistake‚Ä¶ They are our national heritage and draw tourists from all over the world. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll have a new nominee just as bad if not worse.. For those of us with short memories due to his chaotic leadership, the damage started long before this guy. https:''thehill.com'...'421910-undoing-the-damage-pruitt.... Carol Perry Macholl As I stated earlier, remove ANY politician that has served more than 8 years! Nancy, Chuck, etc. They have already become multimillionaires AT OUR expense.. In not so many months, all of the clown‚Äôs nominations will be in the unemployment line.. Randy Jeffers Who would ‚Äúyour man‚Äù nominate? AOC, Bernie, Omar, Or some other radical fool?. Most likely a legitimate authority on land management. I know, radical, huh? I'm glad you've clarified that stuffing your pockets at the expense of the people is now the mainstream conservative ethos.. Why is Trump even nominating anyone for any position right now? He has no idea whether he‚Äôll have a second term (let‚Äôs hope not). By the time anyone gets confirmed, it would be just about time to vacate their office when Trump gets escorted out of the White House.. What?  He found somebody worse?  Less qualified?  More interested in gutting the land, air, and water than this twit?  Wow!. Kudrun Pilegrim nah, just a bigger donor.... You win. Kudrun Pilegrim no, the guy remains in the job and continues to lead without senate confirmation. Just another end run around congress.. Probably just decided he was needed more over at the USPS.. Melissa Erwin - Nah; He just hasn‚Äôt got to fire anyone yet this month!. Good call! üçäü§° definitely can‚Äôt have someone that could take the spotlight from his citrusy visage, the Divider-in-Chief, Master of Polarization!! ü§£üòÇ. We not gonna talk about how he looks like an alternate reality Joe Exotic....like if he went to college and got an office job..... James A. Barnes yes!. James A. Barnes More like Joe Chaotic.. Yes!. So now they‚Äôre going to find someone else who doesn‚Äôt have easily discoverable statements in support of selling off federal land?. Exactly.  Since when has anybody who left the Trump administration been replaced by somebody more capable and less corrupt than the temporary appointee that couldn't even pass congressional approve if Mitch had been doing his job?. Andrew Chipperfield true. HOW ARE THERE STILL POSITIONS TO NOMINATE?! The term ends in January!. Javier I√±√≥n People said the same thing in 2016.. 4 years later and he still can't get the job done he promised us would be done by April 2017.What a terrible leader.. Most federal agencies are being run by 'acting' appointments because Trump knows he can't get them confirmed.. very different year.. The Trump administration holds the record for the most unfilled positions. Majority is being run by temps. He‚Äôll just hire a guy that thinks the same but hasn‚Äôt talked about it publicly. Don‚Äôt even start to think he‚Äôs changing his mind about selling off land. He‚Äôs just going to sneak it through.. good.  but the fact trump even considered him is yet another reason to VOTE in historical numbers this Nove to remove him.... He must not have donated enough to Donny's campaign.. Jan Moody Garner both sides take lobbyists money silly. Jan Moody Garner. Just another corrupt wealthy Trump supporter put in place to help his own business in exchange for an illegal campaign donation that somehow landed in Trump‚Äôs personal bank account.  The Republican Senate is too impotent to stop it.  Swampy swampy swampy.. This guy looks like the kind of person who would sell federal land. The bollo just completes the reason not to trust him.. Paul and looks oddly like a bleached and mustached Ted Cruz which is eerily grosser.. They should be rethinking about 100 more of his appointments....... Oh by all means don‚Äôt let public criticism of your reign of terror stop you from plundering more irreplaceable public land! Just because your re-election is coming up doesn‚Äôt mean you have to suddenly become responsible!. I would like to leave my share of public lands to my children, so they may enjoy the grandeur of this great nation.  I won't sell.  Raise your hand if you agree. üñê. I‚Äôd walk 1000 miles -to vote them all out in 2020 if I had too. Make sure your friends get to the polls.. He must have come up with someone less qualified or another one of his big donors that he promised a job or Jared. Some people loved the way this guy managed land, and others didn‚Äôt care for it. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll find some more land to manage soon enough.. the real takeaway is that 4 months from the end of his term and he still hasn't even settled on appointees to offices.. Most of his selections to head governmental departments are corporate executives whose track records aren‚Äôt in the best interest of America.  Where as, that dude looks like he‚Äôs from the porn industry.  Specifically, the 70‚Äôs - 80‚Äôs era.. So he pardoned Joe Exotic and gave him a job?. Always thought hunters and fishermen were the ultimate environmentalists.  Sustainability for future generations.  I would like to think water, air, land, forest protection would promote cooperation with non hunt'fish environmental people",32,"['run', 'protect', 'second', 'destroy', 'take', 'guess', 'political',

his idea destroy from within devos is a clear example destructionists yep look at dejoy and devos jerry jb i agree jerry it is going to take a long time to undo the damage if that is possible i was an nra member and took hunter safety courses now it is all about the benjamins pretty sad catherine howard exactly yes i wonder why only this time the criticism caused a withdrawal catherine howard deconstruction is still the plan jerry jb completely agree true in fact they are there to destroy what their in charge of every one of them justin parton true that catherine howard that is a fact he is evil catherine howard always well said catherine howard absolutely true and his idea of protect means make money off of justin parton correct hunting and hunters fund a large portion of conservation efforts not all hunters are crazy maga 2nd amendment nuts for a lot of people in this country hunting is an important tradition and equates to spending time with and learning from family as long as you are responsible and respectful hunting can be seen as more respectable than just buying slaughter house fodder catherine howard always catherine howard it is almost like him and his followers hate america jerry jb i have yet to meet anyone who did not have an ancestor who was a hunter i am 67 years old well if you break an agency you can say that it does not work and sunset it catherine howard so true catherine howard exactly catherine howard yeah like getring one of the most ignorant people he knows to run the department of education what is up with that those are the very best people he pledged to help run his administration really catherine howard cruella devilles every one catherine howard exactly catherine howard i am waiting for him to appoint farmer john to head the union of orthodox rabbis catherine howard that is the plan of this administration to dismantle all the departments and destroy the u s as we know it that is why all the wolves are put in charge of the hen houses this is good news but may just mean that he is knows he will not get approved pendley is already acting director so my guess is trump will keep him on till the end of his term to do as many evil deeds as possible daniel collay it is political theater odds are good trump will lose so what is the point of filling a post for a few months at best which just means he has found someone equally unqualified or worse barbara havens joe exotic all public lands and the natural resources therein should first supplement old age pension and public healthcare and held in perpeturity for this purpose john kimball great idea try getting current politicians to do it this is a start but he must be removed and not allowed to remain as acting director tell your elected representatives raising hell matters keep marching keep contacting elected officials selling off our federal lands would be a huge mistake they are our national heritage and draw tourists from all over the world i am sure he will have a new nominee just as bad if not worse for those of us with short memories due to his chaotic leadership the damage started long before this guy carol perry macholl as i stated earlier remove any politician that has served more than 8 years nancy chuck etc they have already become multimillionaires at our expense in not so many months all of the clowns nominations will be in the unemployment line randy jeffers who would your man nominate aoc bernie omar or some other radical fool most likely a legitimate authority on land management i know radical huh i am glad you have clarified that stuffing your pockets at the expense of the people is now the mainstream conservative ethos why is trump even nominating anyone for any position right now he has no idea whether he will have a second term let us hope not by the time anyone gets confirmed it would be just about time to vacate their office when trump gets escorted out of the white house what he found somebody worse less qualified more interested in gutting the land air and water than this twit wow kudrun pilegrim nah just a bigger donor you win kudrun pilegrim no the guy remains in the job and continues to lead without senate confirmation just another end run around congress probably just decided he was needed more over at the usps melissa erwin nah he just has not got to fire anyone yet this month good call definitely cannot have someone that could take the spotlight from his citrusy visage the divider in chief master of polarization we not gonna talk about how he looks like an alternate reality joe

It puts a responsibility where it doesn't belong.. Meghan ElizabethYou are so right! So eloquently put! It is disheartening, dehumanizing, emotionally violent, and physically dangerous what much of America is asking; nay, demanding of our teachers right now! It's outrageous and it's wrong. And I suppo‚Ä¶See More. Great. I'll see one prescreened child at a time, by appointment only, in a completely sterile environment, in full scrubs for 10-15 min then send them home. And the parents can come too, be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it's their turn. I'll see 15 children a day.. So many wonderful people in healthcare. And then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with. They think the whole workforce is to meet their standard. There are many occupations that deserve equal respect‚Ä¶See More. Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Pretty sh*tty to pit two professions that have been so mistreated during the pandemic against each other. That said, if you‚Äôve never taught in a public school, you have no idea how impossible it is to keep yourself and a classroom full of kids from spreading this virus.. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.   If it  is  not  safe  for  football,  theaters,  and  innperson in person meetings,  kids  do  not  need  to  go  to in  person  school.. So I have been a nurse for over 40 years, still working in a hospital. I know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe.

Jadine Sayer and people aren't dying at the rate 'science said humans would' by touching the front of our masks, then touching other stuff that other people who touch the front of their mask go to touch.  If people would really watch what others do you'd never leave your house and have others bring germs to you!. We have learned this guy has changed his mind on every turn. Just like the weather channel they will be more than happy to look out the window to tell you if it's raining.'. Lynette Simonson Knudsen I am not a fan of Impeached Donald trump, but he didn't tell people to drink bleach. He implied bleach kills the virus (which it does).. Lynette Simonson Knudsen Sorry, where did I become a science denier for slating people who don't adapt to evidence?. James R Woodhead science denier much?? Better to drink bleach then?üòâ. Tyson Zufelt Really. Science the first admission was there was no way mask would work at all. What science would change in order for you to do an about face on that. My year of qualitative and quantitative analysis was not a waste.. Kenny Drasen there‚Äôs this thing called Trial and Error. Lesson: Use common sense, believe in science rather in a megalomaniacs daily rantweets. Aditya Narayan , herd immunity.  Look it up. It works. Oh wait you can't spread fear with it like the left wants to do. And I see more hate and fear coming out of the left than the right. So you should actually use reL common sense these days.. Wow this is pointless.. Idiots like Robert D Clarkson haven't read a non fiction book on their own accord their entire life. They get their source of informstion from facebook articles and mainstream news. And then callnother people sheep while he baaaaaaaaaaaaaas all over Facebook. Just ignore them. No point. Johnny Mac sheep. Esca Jensen It's a Coronavirus and like any other of its kind it's not going to disappear nor is there a successful Vaccine due to the constant Mutations. I don't believe that we can hide from a virus at some point everyone will be infected.. Esca Jensen before you continue with your bias, one word... Switzerland.. Esca Jensen Glad you realize it. There's no cure for stupidity.. Wow..... I can't believe the amount of NEGATIVITY?! What is that all about? He is the good guy, who had and has to put up of a goverment that doesn't let him do his job..... Matthias Friedrich , this man doesn't know how to do his actual job. He is a fear mongering mouth piece for the liberal left.. Robert D Clarkson. Robert D Clarkson how is telling people to social distance and wear a mask for public safety ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù you‚Äôre smoking crack. Robert D Clarkson anti intellectualism is not an intelligent look.. Matthias Friedrich Funny! I‚Äôve never heard that before. üôÑ And it ‚Äòs my married name because I not a freak of nature or a pervert.. Neda Suhail saying masks aren't necessary is not a 'context.' Especially from one who is supposedly the expert.. Kevin Miller atta boy, Kev!. Kevin Miller That‚Äôs the stupidest comment I have seen. Did you finish school?. Rajesh Singh Did you ever start?. Matthias Friedrich lol... sorry! üòÇ. We all can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt caught on to what happening.. ...people were begging Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act so that we could have masks ; so that we could get ventilators and instead of helping out the United States in our time of need, he was telling people -> 'you don't need a mask, the virus is a hoax, go to work'. Thanks, everybody for responding.... I will make sure to never, ever comment on a post in Facebook ever again..... lol. Matthias Friedrich just some pathetic trump groupies having tantrums. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Johnny Mac he graduated from Facebook University. Michael Anthony I think you‚Äôre confusing Fauci with Trump üßê. Hahahahahahahahahaha Fran Tarantella. Johnny Mac yeah ok haha. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. We've learned not to trust this doctor.. Darrell Spurlock Jr.. Found the sheep who hasn't read a book since highschool. Who touts youtube videos, Facebook posts and memes as his information source. And thinks others are sheep LOL.. Dr. QuackNtrump gave us an economy just above the great depression  and 165,000 dead and models are predicting +200,000 dead by election day.  But somehow morons believe it's the fault of the medical professionals.  This would be hilarious if not for the death and suffering and 20 million unemployed Americans.. Apparently him and the rest of his trumpanzees that get their sources from youtube videos. Harry Thu a ‚ÄúMAGA Yell Loudly‚Äù graduate from the University of YouTube is a highly coveted achievement, in some circles!. Robert D Clarkson. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Randy Whetstine is he around anyone outside of his bubble? No this isn't him being hypocritical.. Brittany Golden youve said that everytime, is that all you can add to the conversation. Cassandra Mcdaniel think you mean 'without'. Cassandra Mcdaniel some brain you must have trusting Trumps opinion over the guy who is a million times more qualified.. Spreading fear is not something i see as medical , he should learn how to speak before talks to groups and tells us 'The message is DANGER' like a old gospel revival before the Revivalist releases a bag of snakes in the church and demands faith. I like NATGEO , i don't like people that spread fear.. Exactly what 'fear' are you referring to? He's been trying for months, as additional knowledge is gained, to have Americans, all Americans, protect themselves until a viable vaccine is distributed.. Snake Handling is not a good way to convince people in medicine. You mean like trump spreading fear every time he speaks.. He  knocks  HCQ  because  it  works  and  if  people  took  it  they  wouldn‚Äôt  need  Remdesivir,  which  he  has  a  stake  in. Lisa Flynn go for it what do you have to lose?, chances are you are asymptotic and it‚Äôs just a drug. And then you can tell everyone it saved your life. You sound like you know what‚Äôs going on or maybe a stable genius.. https:''www.euronews.com'...'large-global-study-suggests.... Ahhh.. the LA Times!  I feel better now.. Otro corrupto genocida y falso totalmente, s√≥lo busca el y la oms acabar hasta con un 90% a la poblaci√≥n, sigan idolatrandolos no la de borregos.. Lisa Flynn then he‚Äôs lying. Did he tell you that when you‚Äôre on this drug you have to go for what‚Äôs called a field vision test every six months to check for macular damage? Did he tell you that it can take up to 2 years for the drug to leave your body completely?. Your reasonable, reliable and accurate source for your statement is.....?. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Jadine Sayer I  don‚Äôt  need  it.  I  was  asking  in  case  I  did.  The  people  who  took  HCQ  early  had  almost  immediate relief.  One  of  them  was  fighting  two  types  of  cancer,  took  HCQ  on  a  friday Friday and  was  back  to  work  Monday.  If  you  have  faith  in  ventilators and  vaccines then  stick  with  it.  I  sincerely  hope  they  work  for  you.. The problem is the wrong information that we have from the beginning of this pandemic. The arrogance of the president and the loss souls of the scientific community. Just to please the miss information of the politicians. America proud of my country Spain. We are together in this and we are fighting to have a better way of life. With responsibility.. Wait for the introduction people this is a scientist explaining science and it‚Äôs not the long-haired dude with the ball hat on he‚Äôs just doing the introducing. National Geographic, where are the pictures we love? The indigenous societies we love to discover? The world beauty you show? Who wants a corrupt doctor in a magazine about nature? You suck!!!!!. Give Lisa her pitcher book! üòÇü§£üòÇ. Lisa Beth sniff sniff. Typos and auto correct happen. Im I getting graded on this? Lol. Benedikt Kuhn don‚Äôt be an asshole please. Lisa Beth in other articles, especially in the actual magazine.. Corrupt doctor......ignorant people....this is why we laugh at you. The good doctor, that would be a great idea for a tv show!. Russia isn't experiencing a second wave.Russia has developed a vaccine.Russia is sharing the vaccine with the  rest of the world.Be like Russia: talk less, act more.. What expertise does Bowser bring to the table re pandemics? NatGeo is disgracing itself by providing platform to partisan hacks and politicos. Sure way to lose readership.. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Carlos Daniel Do you know how to read? My comment questions choice of Bowser. Do some research if you don‚Äôt know who she is. And stop disgracing yourself by ad hominem attacks.. Rajesh Singh you're the one turning it into a political thing, Fauci never took any political side and never tried to turn any of this into politics. People like you are the problem, he's just trying to do what he did all his life, trying to help people.. That the entire government system is corrupt. Including the doctors hospitals any this man on your picture. Curious on how much stock you own in Moderna? So quick to rule out a Russian vaccine. The history of Moderna is an interesting read. Quite the investment company there. Inside trading, poor history of a drug that actually worked. Poor ethics. And majority back by the central bank.. Todd Murphy he Russian vaccine is rushed and not properly tested, they have not released any information come the first two rounds of testing, so yes he feels that it my not be a good vaccine, as you and everyone should. Because they can hurt you if th‚Ä¶See More. You will learn that your so called experts is the worst blunder in the history!. The very day after the elections, the virus is totally gone........ Ted Giannopoulos just from the US or from all the other countries?. Typical north american, thinks that the whole world spins around the US. derp derp derp derp, derp derp derp........ Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Mimi Cronin I don‚Äôt know... but I do care for America,. Ted Giannopoulos Exactly. You don't know. But you're more than willing to present your poorly-formed opinion as fact.. ABC and national geographic, is main stream media not experts. How is the mayor of D.C an expert tooü§î. All l know is that pandemics are not new. Humanity have witnessed periodic outbreaks of epidemics and pandemics since the dawn of time. Mankind has endured & we have had huge strides in terms of prevention, scientific advancement, sanitation, treatment and vaccination.. Looking forward to it!. Science is about changes and how we should deal with them. So it's not about changing mind but adapting to what is.. We‚Äôve learned that evil politicians are so quick to politicize anything they see fit to try and destroy an opponent no matter how negative it‚Äôs effects are on the American people.. That we haven't learned anything.. This is ridiculous. Extinction is the only way to stop pandemics. Every species has them, and will until their all dead. Stop treating medicine like magic. Embrace the population reduction.. Stephanie Sarah ok first the world will not be flooded like 'water world' if all the ice shells melt, second the last one in Canada just fell, not the last one in the world. Third if we stay on earth eventually we would be fucked because the sun will e‚Ä¶See More. Tyson Zufelt the earth is way over populated. We dont have a chance. The last ice shelf just fell. You better buy a boat.. Stephanie Sarah the world is no where near overpopulated what a stupid statement. To most, science is just an opinion. And money can buy opinions.. You lost me with the inclusion of Bowser...........seriously???. Conservatives are going to come out the closet for this one & demonstrate their inability to function on planet earth.. Andres Ruiz , death cult????? Your mind is so warped. Fine wear your mask. I won't. I'll be the one that will see the finish line.. Robert D Clarkson bc wearing a mask is difficult rocket science. Anti-Maskers are in bed with neo Nazis & there is hardly any difference between the two so yeah you are brutally racist redneck scholar.. I wasn't too far off there was I?. Andres Ruiz you must be joking? Masks? Really? I‚Äôve seen hundreds and hundreds of them without masks.. do some research into who funded the wuhan lab. Kellie Dibble. I guess those who posted the haha emoji are know-it-alls or get their info from their cousin who works as assistand hairdresser in East Shrewhampton... Kelly Sweeney I hearted her comment and everything lmao. Shakeela Ameera I am not sure I understand but whether we like it or not science is science. We like it when the doctors save our lives don't we? We like it when science makes our lives comfortable. But we do not like it when it urges us to be responsible citizens.. Love the doctor death picture, its a classic. üíÄ. Why are we afraid of a virus that‚Äôs less deadly than the flu?. Natgeo not classy now, you sold your soul?. Russia Vaccine isn't going to work for Fauci either..   He has nothing invested in that group.... The last RNA vaccine we tried killed so many people we stopped trying.. I bet he's not first in line for it.... Great! A former CEO of Moderna and one of the funders was Epstein. NatGeo is losing the plot. Piss off Disney. The funder of Epstein https:''www.youtube.com'watch?v=5K7sa7EeUGc.

Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè.

not mean that there is a conspiracy or that there is ill intent we take an oath to first do no harm mari machado yet they claim to be the bestest nation in the world hypocrisy at its finest it is not amazing it is intentional unfortunately americans are distracted by the clown in office to realize a 6x bankrupted con man with over 35k lawsuits pending against him for cheating blue collar workers over 40 sexual accusations against very true mari as early as when i was in college people still respected scientists and admired the highly educated and wanted to be educated themselves what the f ck happened nowadays people are experts in their own minds after watching a 3 minute youtube video and slamming experts with decades of learning and hard work behind them like dr fauci it is sad scary and frustrating so fauci took that oath too does not look like it had no idea so many science illiterate conservatives followed nat geo derek donnell herd immunity see we believe in real science not the bs you say will work but keep trying robert d clarkson may i ask what university your degree in virology is from colin babb 100 a bot robert d clarkson believe science is the oposite of beliefs follow evidence where they lead and not ignoring them in order to support what you want things to be there is no beliefs in science we follow evidences and you swallow youtube stupidity the science illiterate are the ones believing the numbers right out the gate and it is not the conservative derek donnell laughing at paralyzed children says a lot about your character i have been following the bill gates foundation for almost a decade he has committed crimes against humanity he deserves to burn in hell for the pain and suffering he has caused wake up amy halligan let me guess trump u grad i had an inkling natgeo comment fields are always interesting derek donnell and how many did they innoculate let me guess you believe men have periods too do not you yay science look at the numbers instead of opinion pieces derek donnell i was just thinking the same thing and the views are staggeringly paranoid and illogical amy halligan and the league of stupid women here you go with trying to link conservatism with illiteracy as well as ability to perceive when the govt is bullshitting you patrick anwandter what no retort yeah that is what i thought typical cowardice from a gaslighting astroturfing shill derek donnell i actually agree with alex here since many think science only happens in school and not in real life so they refuse to accept what is happening robert d clarkson 50 to 83 population infection to reach the herd immunity threshold for covid19 derek donnell they think the follow makes them vicariously knowledgeable and scientific while not even understanding the words i just typed amy halligan derek donnell says a liberal who believes everything he is told charley thomas charley you really do not know how to think do you derek donnell that is presuming that these comments are by actual human being and not right mongering bots peter lasorte oh really that is the comment you came back with okay karen you seem to have the erroneous belief that your ridiculous views amount to something when in fact they are the feeble musing of a halfwit actually that is giving you way too much credit they musing of a product of a sibling union have a splendid day you are a very disappointing bet all the girls tell you that they seek out things to make themselves angry self triggering derek donnell they have no lives robert tegarden he went to trumpu peter lasorte listen karen have you read the lancet paper re hcq or are you focusing on articles that support your confirmation bias it seems lately that the scientist and mainstream media have been setting the science bar pretty low i remember a time when it took time to develop a knowledge base for the science now the fadscience changes almost daily pavel san martinek well i would hope no independent research on a

mankind has endured we have had huge strides in terms of prevention scientific advancement sanitation treatment and vaccination looking forward to it science is about changes and how we should deal with them so it is not about changing mind but adapting to what is we have learned that evil politicians are so quick to politicize anything they see fit to try and destroy an opponent no matter how negative it is effects are on the american people that we have not learned anything this is ridiculous extinction is the only way to stop pandemics every species has them and will until their all dead

Vote in person only with a photo I.D. The only fair way given the political atmosphere we live in at this point in time.. Why take a chance when you have the mail in option.

Figure a safe and valid way for those that can‚Äôt. why doesn't Fauci go home and social distance so this whole thing can be over. Although I prefer to mail in my vote, I am planning to vote in person because I do not trust the suppression of my vote by a person that is making the post office slow the mail on purpose.  However, mail in voting is necessary for people that suffer from cancer and other ailments that keep them tied to a wheelchair or at home because their immune system is compromised.. Can crowds safely go out and protest, gotcha.... If it‚Äôs okay to go to Walmart, you can vote in person‚ÄºÔ∏è. 2 problems.

Kelly Dossman easy to know who said it...it's also true, and what the men in power have done in this country since it's Inception.... Nobody, of course, is 'pitting' minority groups against each other. And the lawsuit is sound -- Yale indeed does discriminate against whites and Asians, and in favor of far less qualified blacks. Far from being the negation of the affirmative action mentality, the university's policy is the very essence of it.. It stands to reason that1) Students who were already admitted, have little to complain about in terms of admissions;‚Ä¶See More. Benjamin Fan 'admissions seemed fair to me' says the guy who got admitted.I don't know enough to form an opinion on Yale's admissions, so I'll leave it at that.. Tim Daniel Sure, but that's to get a more complete picture. Interviewing both those who made it, and those who didn't make it, would make for a well-rounded data set. You'll have students who said 'I was accepted and everything in the process was just ‚Ä¶. Benjamin Fan the study did included rejected applicants and was a rounded data set, of course.  Many many more are rejected than accepted and I would argue that‚Äôs why the study concludes that Yale discriminates.  This Article focuses on those who dispute the study‚Äôs findings.  That‚Äôs why the quotes are from accepted students only.  Gonna be difficult to get a valid conclusion.  That‚Äôs my point.. Benjamin Fan Students have no issues criticizing their institution while there. I've spent 18 years on campuses as student and employee.. Benjamin Fan They aren't going to to criticize who admitted them into one of the hardest places to get in to...you wouldn't think ü§î. Stands to reason that, having 20% of Asians vs 5% black students seems disproportionated for an American school since the country is comprised of  ~15% black people and 5% ~ Asians. Jorge Andres Ramirez Many of these are not even citizens, having bought millionaires visas to send their kids to American colleges. Trump is selling the condos and visas.. Jorge Andres Ramirez  what about sports scholarship ?? Why is 15% black taking almost 100% in basketball and football scholarship?? ü§î Well! best of the best or let‚Äôs start granting sports scholarship to all average fat kids based on population?.  I think the article was rushed, not up to usual NYTimes standards, in its zealousness to prove a point. A more thorough article would make a greater attempt to interview both existing Yale students and rejected students and compare and contrast their attitudes, not just the plaintiffs. This result just plays into the reporter's confirmation bias.. NY Times isn't that high on standards. You will find bias here and   there. Yale University discriminates....period.. I-Lin Kuo  Your initial statement? ü§î. David Johnson My initial statement points to a concrete criticism of a single article. It does not imply that the criticism is applicable to the paper as a whole.. Selection bias. Of course they say that. The NYT works by selective emphasis. It is comfort food for a certain class.

Because Democrat run cities and states are so safe and well run right now?. Eddie Bell Lol. So, the largest demographic admitted face discriminationü§î.  Because the DOJ failed their suit against Harvard, they're going after Yale.  Obviously, they want the issue before the Supreme Court.  Pathetic.. So the students who made the cut dont care about others who didnt make the cut, solely because they were discriminated against.. Yup.  Gee, a Yale student does not want to say publicly that the school discriminates.  Meanwhile, Yale & Harvard run quotas. not how it works-they think that they are better not luckier -but they are a number of individuals I guess each feels/thinks about this differently. Not all cultures put an equal emphasis on education. Therein lies the problem, possibly.... Just drag the proceedings out to January and then Poof! they will disappear along with Barr.. I really want to have this conversation, starting with legacy admissions.. Yale had better prepare to write a yuuuge settlement check. The administration unlawfully discriminated against Asians and Whites!. Stands to reason that the Barr ‚ÄúJustice Department‚Äù which saw nothing wrong with dismissing charges against Flynn would want to cause division wherever it can.. The FBI's own memo's show that Flynn never 'lied', and now it is also known that the FBI threatened to go after members of Flynn's family on bogus charges if he didn't plead 'guilty.' It's called 'prosecutorial misconduct' ---and the charges against Flynn needed to be dropped for the sake of justice.. Michael Froebe don‚Äôt you mean biggley rather than big-huge. Let me guess you believe in QAnon and pizzagate.. you have the right to believe what ever-but as the prosecutors majorly did wrong-even had he been convicted he would walk-Brady rule is like big-hugeIn that case, the Supreme Court established a rule that prosecutors must disclose ‚ÄúBrady material‚Äù to the defense. The failure to disclose such material is a ‚ÄúBrady violation,‚Äù a violation of the U.S. Constitution.. Mexican American students are not rushing to Yale University. Cute article about kids who will have nothing to worry about in life.. love it.. Love when libs eat their own. Dog eat dog world. Jon Cassett because only Liberals get a higher education?.

rule out the possibility of covid. I know all deaths at this time are all considered COVID related..... Jackie Roemish lmao no they aren't. Jackie Roemish that would really surprise me if that were true.  Where are you getting that info?. Diane It isn‚Äôt. This person is trolling and/or spreading misinformation.. Cari Page actually , you are wrong . I hear it first hand from nurses and doctors .. Natallia Fairchild Cari Page is a nurse. And when a person dies there is more than 1 space on the death certificate so yes they could die from complications of Covid.. Jackie Roemish we would have exponentially more deaths if that was the case üôÑ. Jackie Roemish there are roughly (very rough estimate) 7,000 deaths per day in the US from various causes. Today is day 227 of the year meaning there have been about 1.5 million deaths in the US from any cause. If all deaths are considered covid related then why isn't the death toll for Covid in the US 1.5 million?. Shelly Marie Dollar Witt it wasnt on this thread but I believe it's on this post-  a woman named tonya share a pic of someone with leg issues and then it says covid related- that's a bit alarming you would think if a death had absolutely nothing to do with covid, then they wouldn't put covid, but I guess not. ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è. Amanda Foy I completely agree with you. I think this happens ALL the time!!  Just like the guy who died from a car crash and was tested later to have it. They said he died from COVID.. Terri Marie I thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake.. Terri Marie I thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake.. Big difference between the words 'With' and 'Of'. IE, He died with Rona not of.. Plus hearing of false 'positives'; the post death test could be one of those.. No one dies from heart attacks or cancer anymore. Tony DeVore Exactly.. We know of a young man who scheduled a test, 2 week's prior to having a SX. Schedules changed, so he didn't show up for the test due to canceling the SX & 2 week's later, he received a letter in three mail telling him that his 'test' came back positive . Tonya Johnson makes it hard to know what to believe anymore ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è. Amanda Foy üéØ. Yea bunch of bullshhhttt. Fake  virus lmao. A really good friend of mine mom died cause of Covid19. Please stop this shit!!! It was terrible to watch and the family still is going through hell. That is how they are keeping control.. Yeah because hospitals get tax kick backs for how many covid cases they deal with so they catagorize as much as they can accordingly. Seth Linde  Which drives numbers up, which feeds panic. The medical system is corrupt through and through but they are not necessarily being diabolical in this case. Hospitals are literally hemoraging money because they cannot perform the elective and ‚Ä¶See More. I can speak from experience... when someone dies, the king county health department (coroner) tests and has been testing everyone for the ‚ÄòRona. Everyone... hence why a gunshot victim or 3 (known) were labeled as Covid deaths even tho they were killed by bullets. Jashawa Scotch yep, even if they are on hospice for any other reason. Maybe we need to compare death rates in the US from 2019 to 2020 to put things in better perspective. The research I did indicated year to year from March through May (not counting accidents) there were 120,000 more deaths this year during that time period. I would love  to see more reporting that puts numbers into a historical perspective. More helpful than just raw data.. Where is the paper proof.   Pull out the death certificates.. Not surprised.

It spilled at least 1,000 tons of oil into the Indian Ocean ‚Äî causing what scientists call the worst ecological disaster in the country's history.","all those boats Japan has killing whales 'for science' and they can't even take care of their fleet. They should clean the area up and mandate funds for a local fish/coral hatchery. Their government doesn't need japans money because they will waste it anyways. Targeted funding.. This year is cursed! This breaks my heart üíî poor marine wildlife and ecosystem. I wouldn‚Äôt care if Japan went bankrupt cleaning up this f@&$)(; mess.. Some alternative fuel sources would be wonderful, it's too bad that windmills cause cancer.. Shawn Nuthall and that solar panels will drain the sun.. Shawn Nuthall then, I'm assuming ocean tidal wave power generator will cause tsunami. Shawn Nuthall nah they kill the üê¶ by the hundreds... üê¶ cemeteries.... Electromagnetism is your future energy drive, earthlings. Embrace it in its simplicity or count down your inevitable destruction.. Jay Douglas So do cats..... Imagine driving your car into public pond or lake and just leaving it there. You'd probably be arrested and fined, but when it comes to oil tankers it's ok because 'you use petroleum products, right ?'. Roxlau Islais it wasn‚Äôt an oil tanker.. Japan should take transparent ecological responsibility for this disaster in terms of compensation to that county and individual residents of the local area affected.. Japan... east asia is not all the same place. August Kersten Japan üáØüáµ!. As with many nations of Japan‚Äôs stature in the global community they will no doubt stay silent.. Japan is still leaking nuclear waste if I‚Äôm not mistaken.  They continue to wreak havoc Globally..... Breaking: American complains about Japan‚Äôs use of nuclear technology. Lol @ reek. Erik Weston it wasn't the Japanese that made Hiroshima or Nagasaki radioactive.... It‚Äôs not being collected and stored like the stuff at Hanford which leaks a tiny bit as storage tanks degrade. Raquel Leiva Fukushima didn‚Äôt happen??. Raquel Leiva actually it kind of depends on how you look at it- if Japan hadn‚Äôt killed millions of people and tried to take over half of the world- Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not have been bombed.. Ok yeah Japan is slacking, wtf?. human beings are the worst thing to ever happen to the planet.  the sooner we go extinct the better. There's just no learning when it comes to oil transport.  It's the definition of insanity.. Georgia Willis  that literally is not the definition of insanity. It‚Äôs a misattributed quote from Einstein that can‚Äôt even be validated as Einstein‚Äôs quote... because he didn‚Äôt say it. I really wish it would go away üôÉ. Georgia Willis you‚Äôre awful condescending for someone who didn‚Äôt read the article.. We all know that fossil fuel is bad but who really cares as long as it run our car and everything we need. Tomorrow we will ship more and more. They weren‚Äôt shipping it as you say, they were using it as fuel, which is currently the only option for moving cargo ships unless you prefer nuclear power. Even then they will have tons of oil-based lubricants and such on board.. David McLeod its a Fuel oil right?. Whoa. Exxon-like malfeasance again. The Valdez spill in Alaska. This is another long enduring horror.. Sigh... the number of idiots commenting about ‚Äúoil tankers‚Äù without reading the story.... Oil, radioactive material, overfishing... Japan loves the ocean.. Joseph Stark a rather stupid comment, it was an accident, and not a foreseeable one.. Fine and arrest the owner of the ship!!. Josh Bell why? It was an accident, and not a foreseeable one.. 'Worst ecological disaster in the country's history' is misleading, since Mauritius has only been a country since 1968. The ship sinkings in the region during the Second World War dwarf this accident by orders of magnitude.. 'Worst ecological disaster' slipped right past you. War is not a 'ecological disaster'... Ralph, oh man, this is what got you all worked up??Priorities buddy.. Nah, it's a slow news day, Tim üòÉ At least I'm not arguing that an ecological disaster is a disaster caused by the environment, or whatever that fool was trying to prove üòÉ. Where‚Äôs the UN! They need to force country like Japan to clean up!. Nothing outlasts the destruction of 2020. It keeps going and going and going.... Japan should clean it up ASAP. Such a nuisance leaving it like that!!. So Fukushima was what??.. Sara Brown worst ecological disaster in Mauritius' history, not Japan's.. Mauritius, for those not keeping track of extinctions, was the home of the Dodo bird. It no longer is, because the Dutch just killed them all after they got there.. There goes all the Amazon delivery vetoes !. Worse than Fukushima? Yikes.... If Krammerico had only won their patent.. Send Japan the bill for all associated cost.. still, we continue to make the same mistakes over and over again and again,why?. Fabrizio Montanar Profit for some.. This is devastating.  The lemon juice in the gaping wound that is 2020.. where are the hasmat wearing clean-up crews???????? what phenomenal irresponsibility. the planet is dying from pollution and this???? W T F ?. What does run aground mean? What caused the split and how long did it take to split? Thanks for the info in advance y'all.. We have got to stop using fossil fuel.  Enough of big oil oligarchies.. WTF üáØüáµ clean this disaster up!. To be fair... That is an *awesome* photo.. An ounce of prevention, is worth a pound of cure üò¢. Mauritius depends on the sea, too.. Leave the oil in the ground!!. Wind and solar would not do that!. Where is the Japanese company  that owns the ship? Can't they launch a recovery and cleanup?. Get ready to foot a BIG bill, Japan.. Japan needs to fix this and give restitition immediately.. The front fell off? Was it made from Cardboard? Card board derivitates?. can we stop using oil to run ships please?. Kai Lau you prefer nuclear power? Because that is currently the only viable alternative.. 2020 - the hits keep coming. One wonders where allegiances are these days..

Why don't they ever spill oil off their own coasts?. Cuthbert Jolly indeed.. Allison Levin The two major ones being of foreign origin.. We definitely need less regulations on oil and gas, right trumpers?. Your comment makes no sense. Regulations on oil and gas don‚Äôt prevent ships from running aground. Furthermore this is a Japanese vessel that broke apart in the Indian Ocean. At least you got your Trump mention in though. God knows we need to discuss Trump after every single article ever written. That never gets old or repetitive.. Hahaha! I wondered how far I would have to go to find someone with a raging case of TDS!. This is why my daughter (20) said she is never having kids.

Now, he has an 11-point lead over the incumbent president, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Here's how he got to this point:","Pretty straightforward, few were excited for him, same with most of the other candidates, because the democratic party is struggling to stay relevant and their only real strength is in rallying against a disastrous Trump presidency. Still voting for him and kamala though.. We cannot become complacent!  Remember to vote.. Vote shaming wont change a persons mind. Its 100% reasonable for someone who would NEVER vote for Trump or Biden to vote third party or write in. Thats how it works.. Mario Simmons I'd love to return to the legislation that was in place before trump steamrolled it all back with acting directors.. Scott Yep it will be really sad if the Dems lose to him again, to bad they dont want progressive allies.. Mario Simmons you haven‚Äôt been paying attention then. Democrats are pushing for Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, student debt relief, mail in voting during a pandemic, among other initiatives. That is not ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt trump‚Äù, that is a lot of policies that would help the common person in America, not just the 1% and corporations like the Republicans are pushing.. Sue Greenhause no, still very much favor making money for insurances.. Stacie Hall but they aren‚Äôt in court trying to dismantle the affordable care act either. Zane Smith I guess you are fine with Trump staying in power.  Hope the rest of Bernie‚Äôs supporters are smarter than that.. It's more than filling out your ballot. It's making sure it gets to the elections office. I'm delivering mine in person. Early. And then checking to make sure it gets counted.. Oh, I will...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zEkR-D6TnQ. Mario Simmons when asked what he wanted to accomplish in his second term... trump drew a blank. Zane Smith then you‚Äôre voting for tRump.  Nice work!ü§®. Zane Smith I‚Äôm not a fan of splitting the vote. I too would prefer a much more progressive candidate (Warren would be my choice), but by writing in, you‚Äôre giving trump a tiny advantage. I am more against giving trump any advantage than I am for any candidate running against him.. Benjen Sanchez yes, yes, yes!. Benjen Sanchez for Howie Hawkins üëç. Mario Simmons Not gonna argue that there aren't issues with the current lineup, but ;Not Trump' means A LOT. Not Trump means free and fair elections, it means a government and its institutions not being systematically dismantled, it means a stop to the‚Ä¶See More. Mario Simmons If your definition of ‚Äúreasonable ‚Äú includes wasting your vote.  If you want a strong independent party you need to start working diligently six or eight years out, developing candidates, getting them elected, and raising sums of money equivalent to the two major parties. Otherwise a vote for an independent is both naive and an exercise in futility.. Vote Blue, join the cavalry!. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing as in 2016 and expecting different results. Take charge of the moment and fight rather than preaching togetherness. You can‚Äôt bring a divided nation together by losing an election.. Marc JBraunstein , Google: who won the popular vote in 2016, Dingus....The people lost because of some dated rules. It's not going to happen this time around I assure you.. Ric Otero But the electoral college still exists, so the same exact thing is likely to happen again. The democrats need to understand this is an uphill battle in the swing states. I drove by about 3 times more Trump signs than Biden on my way to the st‚Ä¶See More. J√≥zef Joestar II It's interesting listening to early episodes of Pod Save America, a podcast commentary from Obama admin guys, from early 2017. They insist the DNC lost for very specific reasons and they can't use those same tactics or they will suffer the same fate in 2020. All of their reflection has gone to waste.... Ric OteroTo be fair: those dated rules you mentioned haven't actually gone anywhere. Going for a moderate candidate may not have been the best move here. We won't win over any Trump supporters no matter how much we try to compromise with them.. Valerie, sad but true.  Biden offers nothing but 'not Trump.'. Excuse me, but the GOP is running on the exact same platform they used in 2016. Trump is recycling his smear tactic of questioning a candidate's eligibility because of their citizenship. He's still crying 'But her emails!'  He's living in the past with no new plans for the next four years. No one is interested in reruns of his bad four year reality show.. Jason Seow That‚Äôs not entirely true though. Some have figured it out and are not voting for him again. Follow @Trump_Regrets on twitter. It gives me a little bit of hope.. Ric Otero google ‚Äúhow to win a presidential election in the United States‚Äù.. Marc JBraunstein , togetherness is a huge word. It's simple in structure but, so very complicated in action.. Marc JBraunstein this ain't 2016. POLLS SHMOLES. I will only do my vote. Polls mean zip in this election war. There is too much postal chaos trump is initiating.. Shirley Fenile yeah since the last election, you can‚Äôt trust polls. Just yourself and to encourage every non-voter to register to vote!. Shirley Fenile This is going to sound nuts.   Drive or walk to a polling place, bring ID, wait in line, then vote.. David Rout I have mail in 30 yrs. No thx.. I am not sure a pbs/npr poll is a true representation of the American people.  I want Biden to win but I'm not gonna be blindsided like I was last election.  No complacency. Vote.. Oh, he does know the difference,  just prefers to go along with rhe one who speaks what he thinks.. Agree with you on the need to avoid complacency, BUT please study up a little on how polling works. Reputable organizations *sponsor* polls, but don't have anything to do with how they're conducted. NPR/PBS hired experts to do the actual poll. There ar‚Ä¶See More. Don't want to sound like a broken record, but in 2016 all it took was a few 10,000s people in swing states to go 'meh, I'll vote 3rd party or write in to show 'em.' Please, for the sake of the world and the human race we cant afford tantrums like that.. Kelvin Ng well maybe ur party should stop putting forward trash candidates. Ross Caudill just keep laugh reacting my comments bc you have nothing valid to say. We see right through your laugh reacts.. Frank Baker Dempsey trash candidates? Let‚Äôs talk about Trump. I‚Äôm down for more party recognition and support, but not this election....a ramp up in 3rd Party or Independent support this election is a guaranteed win for Trump.  One goal....get Trump out of the White House, and then let 2024 be a free for all election.. Nick Cavaioli There's no need for or else, because we are already there.. Your right Trump 2020. Kelvin Ng it took a lot more people voting for a DC outsider con man because the Dem choice didnt campaign hard in swing states.. Millie Cox That is false. It will be a vote for whom ever I voted for. Hilary lost because she insulted Democrats and didn‚Äôt try to win them over after the primary. She didn‚Äôt inspire people. I voted for her because she wasn‚Äôt Trump, but I didn‚Äôt want ‚Ä¶See More. Kelvin Ng truth, brother. Truth.. Billy Flynn in prison!. Biden is a republican with dementia.. That's why Trump hired kanye with tax payers money. Piss. Off. We have the right NOT to vote for trash candidates. Neither of these candidates represent what I want. 3rd party candidates should be allowed on the debate stages. The Left says a 3rd party vote takes a vote away from Biden; the Right says it takes away a vote from Trump. I'm not going to hold my nose and vote for someone.. Jamison Normand nope vote blue-Biden or you have voted for Trump. Ross Caudill screw you & your petty tantrum. Kelvin Ng and my fear is that's exactly what inexperienced, fed-up, newbie under-20's voters will do by voting for Kanye.. Kelvin Ng - Agreed. In 2016 Clinton had a 10 point lead; look what happened.. Kelvin Ng ‚Äúvote for my party or else‚Äù isn‚Äôt democracy, bro. I don't recall that Biden's campaign seemed 'all but over' 6 months ago.  It is just so important that he is elected...we must continue to support him and work to get everyone out to vote for him.. If he loses its his own fault and the Democratic party's fault. His record is horrible. Im sure 100+ million people will not vote for the presidency. Lois Widener Alworth don't be a libtard.  biden will lose.  Or do you want your grandchildren to suffer the same fate as Cannon in a democrapic run country with criminals running rampant and the police non-existent?. Lois Widener Alworth Right. Biden was the top candidate before he even announced he was running.. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt long and rocky lol. The dnc establishment paved his way for drug him along. It‚Äôs fine. Better than trump.. Adam Campbell you‚Äôre right about the first part. The second part is up for debate. It's very motivational, inspirational, and a lesson for our kids to never give up. That even if you are politician who has spent nearly 50 years in Washington DC and has written legislation that protects big banks over ordinary citizens and crime bills that cause an explosion of incarceration rates for non violent offenses, you are never too old or too senile to become President.. James Sohr - grow up!  If you are for Trump vote for him.  Stop with the obfuscation of your intent will irrelevant comparisons.. Damon Fehler Ah, yes. If you believe that there were other candidates who were far more qualified than Joe Biden you must be a Donald Trump supporter.'If you don't vote for Joe Biden, you ain't a Progressive'. Clarence Walker You‚Äôre right. He should be blaming Mitch McConnell, since he‚Äôs sitting on over 400 bills passed by the House. Also, McConnell is responsible for not removing Trump from office during impeachment. Mitt Romney is the ONLY Republican with a shred of real decency and patriotism.. James Sohr he‚Äôs been in office for over 50 years? And he blames trump cause nothing gets done? What‚Äôs wrong with that picture. Grace Colf they both are, that‚Äôs the joke.. You too can be a pedophile and run for president of the USA (or even be the president!). Jack S Wolfie , trump did that!. He got there by mainstream democrats, not on his own platform. There is nothing inspirational about him.. There is plenty for me. He is not a crazy fascist. That is very important.. Zach Tiemann. Zach Tiemann ‚Äúnot Trump‚Äù is enough for me right now.. At this point any Democrat candidate would have had at least a 11 point lead.. Dave Koltes You can hope, but Joe has been... uniquely steady and reassuring here. He's a known, decent quantity. That might not be the case with other Dems who are more easily demonized.. He‚Äôs a horrible pick for the Dems.  So many more qualified  people out there than this lifetime, career politician.  I‚Äôm embarrassed for the Democratic Party.. Casie McCall Clayton How's he fighting? All he does in whine about how no one likes him and how unfair everything is to him. Trump is a weak joke that has weakened America.. Kim Nickells , he renamed the PRU and moved it to another department.  He was called names for starting the travel ban!  It‚Äôs a pandemic, caused by China.. Casie McCall Clayton I think both parties are actively trying to lower the bar. The next round will have a better candidate than the incumbent for the next few generations.. Wayne Wilkinson - did you think of that all by yourself?  Good job!. Casie McCall Clayton you sound ridiculous too.. Casie McCall Clayton yeah he's a businessman all right. Did you remember how he managed to bankrupt his casinos and frauded students at his university? Or the numerous reports of how he underpaid or didn't pay his workers?He's a businessman all right. Doesn't mean he's a good one, or a good president..

He got to this point by the DNC being sketchy AF, but I guess if the old sang holds true, you can‚Äôt hate the player hate the game. Hope he wins or the world implodes 2020.. Zach Miller are we upset? I‚Äôm wonder how the pussy grabbing, pornstar adulterous, reads like a 3rd grader, temper tantrum man child got into office when the majority of America voted for Hillary Clinton?!?.

Mitchell Fellows so what you really want is Trump again... because that's what voting for Kanye gets... my guess is you're voting for Trump and just being sarcastic... which... is oddly more respectable than actually voting for Kanye.

Jada Love-Loveless I am ABSOLUTELY certain with a little basic training your neighborhood food lion cashier could do better than 80% of Congress and the entire white house team.. Polls are so you can let your guard down, thinking your vote don't matter...BUT IT DOES MATTER, GO VOTE..FILL OUT THE ABSENTEE BALLOT REQUEST... RETURN BALLOT ASAP (BEST NOT TO TRUST USPS).

Still ignoring the fact he is in severe cognitive decline?. David Rout Yeah. Plenty to blame on both sides historically and present. Many mistakes.. Yong Park .. Oh lord.. NPR has really sheltered you from reality my friend.. Yong Park Senate blocked Os picks.. David Helms no worse than Trump and more than likely far better relatively speaking.. David Helms yes they are.. That about balances out the Trumpublican/Putin voter obstruction, manipulation, fraud, obfuscation and divisive propaganda campaigns aimed ay Illigitemately stealing another election.  Vote like your life depends on it.  Joe is an honorable compassionate leader who will do his level best to steer the ship of state out of rocky waters.. That‚Äôs because President Obama talked every moderate that was beating him to drop out of the race. The fact that he only has an 11 point lead over Trump perfectly illustrates his ineptitude.. I don‚Äôt even want to know what the poll results are. 538 had Clinton winning by a huge margin right up until election night!. David Leblond That isn't true. 538 consistently warned in the weeks before the election that other media outlets were overestimating Clinton's chances, that the race was tighter than people thought, and that Trump had an electoral college advantage. They had Trump's odds of winning at three in ten which isn't exactly a rare thing.. Yup. 538 had Clinton up by 3.6 percent, and the actual margin was 2.1 percent -- well within all margins of error. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/. Paul Murray exactly it‚Äôs so tiresome this willful ignorance to misunderstand what polls are and mean. It also helps that he hasn‚Äôt had an unscripted interview since 2018.. aww look I hurt its feelings. JD Backberg 11/2017. Kevin Howlett https://youtu.be/JtvGR8UX1L0. And Trump's off script endless video, phone a fox & friend and tweets are proving he needs a padded room. Knock it off! We can see the difference.. David Rout The one who is cheating, again, is worse.. Biden's campaign lacks the energy.  Still hoping he'll win just because he's not Trump, the corrupt, con man who's just looking out for himself.. And if Biden loses they will once again blame everyone BUT themselves for nominating an awful candidate.  The only reason Biden has any chance at all in the general election is Trump.  Imagine how big a lead the Democrats would have if they hadn‚Äôt nominated a ‚Äútransitional president‚Äù.. Alex Gross I'm not a Biden fan, and would vote for a decent Republican over Biden....but I will NEVER give trump my vote... so, Biden it is!! As trump would say... 'what do I have to lose ?' We made it through 4 years of trump... we will survive 4 years of Biden!. Linda Deka My exact same thoughts and feelings!!!. I'll never believe polls again.  Many Trump supporters are too embarrassed to admit they are voting for him.  Vote like you're up against a wannabe dictator who is willing to cheat, cause we are.. Stephanie Striegel The shy or embarrassed Trump voter that doesn't show up in polls is a myth.. Hardy Trenda LaLa right. No one supporting Trump at this point is going to change their mind, but maybe there's enough undecided voters to make a difference.. Paul Murray it‚Äôs hard to imagine any Trump supporter staying silent.. Paul Murray glad to hear it.. Stephanie Striegel agreed!. You're right. Some people don't like trump but are still going to vote for him and they're keep their opinions to themselves. My question is, if you are too embarrassed to openly vote for someone, then why in the heck are you voting for them??. Sue Greenhause Thank you!!!. Vote for your favorite pedophile.  Doesn't matter if it's blue or red you will vote for a pedophile slaves.. Gail Cain me too...every day!  This is definitely the election of our lifetime!. Hardy Trenda LaLa it's funny because he hates everyone, but loves manipulating people to make them think he's our their side.. Stephanie Striegel I agree with you about not trusting polls, but I think it‚Äôs more likely people who voted for Trump before are more likely not to want to admit that and are are either voting for Biden, not voting for president at all, or writing someone in..

Tex Gill It's a Marsists poll which is a well respected independent polling company. You'd know that if you did even a smidge of research before commenting.. They're not just calling the people who send them money.  And actually PBS and NPR are not biased.. Clearly you don't understand how polling works. Look into it; it's interesting. Take an introductory measurement and statistics course. For senior citizens like you, they're usually free to audit at a state university or community college, and you don't have to meet the admissions requirements.. Paul Murray Besides Gallup is busy with a new girlfriend.Marist works harder and hasn‚Äôt had a date since 97‚Äô.. Rocky? He was handed the nomination.. LeaAndrea Johnson yes, handed as in won by several million votes. LeaAndrea Johnson the fix was in. The DNC did it last go round to Bernie too.. The voters picked Biden over Bernie; the ones who dropped out would have only diluted both their numbers and prolonged the primary. It was a smart tactical move, and tactical thinking is what we expect of political parties intent on winning elections.. Troy Carpenter So, it was the voters that dropped out and endorsed him a day or so before Super Tuesday?. Troy Carpenter so you agree, the party 'tactically' rigged the election üòÅ. Rocky road? As in ice cream, maybe. They handed him the nomination, despite several debate appearances that left most of us wondering why. A desperate move to stop the progressives. Perhaps they were right. Perhaps Biden will do better against Trump than Sanders would have done. But rocky road? Hardly.. Obama convinced the other candidates who were leading Biden to drop out to stop U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Ryan Cab exactly üëå. NPR reporters getting paid for full articles when the story is one sentence long. Ryan Cab are we reading the same thing? I think the title is referring to looking for Obama‚Äôs endorsement.

Matt Marano Biden and his son set a great standard üòÇ. Alana Bowdridge please try harder.. A shanfully DNC trick to kick out Bernie. Antenor Martin Aleman Ramirez are you saying that Bernie did not pull out of his own choice?. No time to be complacent. There are those debates and the issue of turnout. It is a long time yet and the dangerous part for Biden begins now.. Do not become complacent!  We need every single vote.  We need a Blue Tsunami to let the criminals know they're through.. Biden and the DNC don't. Wayne Wilkinson Your profile indicates that you drink a lot.  That probably explains it.. The DNC screwed Bernie Sanders (again) and handed the nomination to the much inferior candidate Biden.. Everyone else dropped out the night before Super Tuesday - not a very long story üôÑ.

their only real strength is in rallying against a disastrous trump presidency still voting for him and kamala though we cannot become complacent remember to vote vote shaming wont change a persons mind its 100 reasonable for someone who would never vote for trump or biden to vote third party or write in thats how it works mario simmons i would love to return to the legislation that was in place before trump steamrolled it all back with acting directors scott yep it will be really sad if the dems lose to him again to bad they dont want progressive allies mario simmons you have not been paying attention then democrats are pushing for medicare for all a 15 minimum wage student debt relief mail in voting during a pandemic among other initiatives that is not we are not trump that is a lot of policies that would help the common person in america not just the 1 and corporations like the republicans are pushing sue greenhause no still very much favor making money for insurances stacie hall but they are not in court trying to dismantle the affordable care act either zane smith i guess you are fine with trump staying in power hope the rest of bernies supporters are smarter than that it is more than filling out your ballot it is making sure it gets to the elections office i am delivering mine in person early and then checking to make sure it gets counted oh i will mario simmons when asked what he wanted to accomplish in his second term trump drew a blank zane smith then you are voting for trump nice work zane smith i am not a fan of splitting the vote i too would prefer a much more progressive candidate warren would be my choice but by writing in you are giving trump a tiny advantage i am more against giving trump any advantage than i am for any candidate running against him benjen sanchez yes yes yes benjen sanchez for howie hawkins mario simmons not gonna argue that there are not issues with the current lineup but not trump means a lot not trump means free and fair elections it means a government and its institutions not being systematically dismantled it means a stop to mario simmons if your definition of reasonable includes wasting your vote if you want a strong independent party you need to start working diligently six or eight years out developing candidates getting them elected and raising sums of money equivalent to the two major parties otherwise a vote for an independent is both naive and an exercise in futility vote blue join the cavalry the definition of insanity is doing the same thing as in 2016 and expecting different results take charge of the moment and fight rather than preaching togetherness you cannot bring a divided nation together by losing an election marc jbraunstein google who won the popular vote in 2016 dingus the people lost because of some dated rules it is not going to happen this time around i assure you ric otero but the electoral college still exists so the same exact thing is likely to happen again the democrats need to understand this is an uphill battle in the swing states i drove by about 3 times more trump signs than biden on my way to the j zef joestar ii it is interesting listening to early episodes of pod save america a podcast commentary from obama admin guys from early 2017 they insist the dnc lost for very specific reasons and they cannot use those same tactics or they will suffer the same fate in 2020 all of their reflection has gone to waste ric oteroto be fair those dated rules you mentioned have not actually gone anywhere going for a moderate candidate may not have been the best move here we will not win over any trump supporters no matter how much we try to compromise with them valerie sad but true biden offers nothing but not trump excuse me but the gop is running on the exact same platform they used in 2016 trump is recycling his smear tactic of questioning a candidates eligibility because of their citizenship he is still crying but her emails he is living in the past with no new plans for the next four years no one is interested in reruns of his bad four year reality show jason seow that is not entirely true though some have figured it out and are not voting for him again follow trump_regrets on twitter it gives me a little bit of hope ric otero google how to win a presidential election in the united states marc jbraunstein togetherness is a huge word it is simple in structure but so very complicated in action marc jbraunstein this as not 2016 polls shmoles i will only do my vote polls mean zip in this election war there is too much postal chaos trump is initiating shirley fenile yeah since the last election you cannot trust polls just yourself and to encourage every non voter to register to vote shirley fenile this is going to sound nuts drive or walk to a polling place bring id wait in line then vote david rout i have mail in 30 yrs no thx i am not sure a pbs npr poll is a true representation of the american people i want biden to win but i am not gonna be blindsided like i was last election no complacency vote oh he does know the difference just prefers to go along with rhe one who speaks what he thinks agree with you on the need to avoid complacency but please study up a little on how polling works reputable organizations sponsor polls but do not have anything to do with how they are conducted npr pbs hired experts to do the actual poll there do not want to sound like a broken record but in 2016 all it took was a few 10 000s people in swing states to go meh i will vote 3rd party or write in to show em please for the sake of the world and the human race we cant afford tantrums like that kelvin ng well maybe ur party should stop putting forward trash candidates ross caudill just keep laugh reacting my comments bc you have nothing valid to say we see right through your laugh reacts frank baker dempsey trash candidates let us talk about trump i am down for more party recognition and support but not this election a ramp up in 3rd party or independent support this election is a guaranteed win for trump one goal get trump out of the white house and then let 2024 be a free for all election nick cavaioli there is no need for or else because we are already there your right trump 2020 kelvin ng it took a lot more people voting for a dc outsider con man because the dem choice didnt campaign hard in swing states millie cox that is false it will be a vote for whom ever i voted for hilary lost because she insulted democrats and did not try to win them over after the primary she did not inspire people i voted for her because she was not trump but i did not want kelvin ng truth brother truth billy flynn in prison biden is a republican with dementia that is why trump hired kanye with tax payers money piss off we have the right not to vote for trash candidates neither of these candidates represent what i want 3rd party candidates should be allowed on the debate stages the left says a 3rd party vote takes a vote away from biden the right says it takes away a vote from trump i am not going to hold my nose and vote for someone jamison normand nope vote blue biden or you have voted for trump ross caudill screw you your petty tantrum kelvin ng and my fear is that is exactly what inexperienced fed up newbie under 20s voters will do by voting for kanye kelvin ng agreed in 2016 clinton had a 10 point lead look what happened kelvin ng vote for my party or else is not democracy bro i do not recall that bidens campaign seemed all but over 6 months ago it is just so important that he is elected we must continue to support him and work to get everyone out to vote for him if he loses its his own fault and the democratic partys fault his record is horrible im sure 100 million people will not vote for the presidency lois widener alworth do not be a libtard biden will lose or do you want your grandchildren to suffer the same fate as cannon in a democrapic run country with criminals running rampant and the police non existent lois widener alworth right biden was the top candidate before he even announced he was running it is was not long and rocky lol the dnc establishment paved his way for drug him along it is fine better than trump adam campbell you are right about the first part the second part is up for debate it is very motivational inspirational and a lesson for our kids to never give up that even if you are politician who has spent nearly 50 years in washington dc and has written legislation that protects big banks over ordinary citizens and crime bills that cause an explosion of incarceration rates for non violent offenses you are never too old or too senile to become president james sohr grow up if you are for trump vote for him stop with the obfuscation of your intent will irrelevant comparisons damon fehler ah yes if you believe that there were other candidates who were far more qualified than joe biden you must be a donald trump supporter if you do not vote for joe biden you as not a progressive clarence walker you are right he should be blaming mitch mcconnell since he is sitting on over 400 bills passed by the house also mcconnell is responsible for not removing trump from office during impeachment mitt romney is the only republican with a shred of real decency and patriotism james sohr he is been in office for over 50 years and he blames trump cause nothing gets done what is wrong with that picture grace colf they both are that is the joke you too can be a pedophile and run for president of the usa or even be the president jack s wolfie trump did that he got there by mainstream democrats not on his own platform there is nothing inspirational about him there is plenty for me he is not a crazy fascist that is very important zach tiemann zach tiemann not trump is enough for me right now at this point any democrat candidate would have had at least a 11 point lead dave koltes you can hope but joe has been uniquely steady and reassuring here he is a known decent quantity that might not be the case with other dems who are more easily demonized he is a horrible pick for the dems so many more qualified people out there than this lifetime career politician i am embarrassed for the democratic party casie mccall clayton how is he fighting all he does in whine about how no one likes him and how unfair everything is to him trump is a weak joke that has weakened america kim nickells he renamed the pru and moved it to another department he was called names for starting the travel ban it is a pandemic caused by china casie mccall clayton i think both parties are actively trying to lower the bar the next round will have a better candidate than the incumbent for the next few generations wayne wilkinson did you think of that all by yourself good job casie mccall clayton you sound ridiculous too casie mccall clayton yeah he is a businessman all right did you remember how he managed to bankrupt his casinos and frauded students at his university or the numerous reports of how he underpaid or did not pay his workers he is a businessman all right does not mean he is a good one or a good president talk about horrible picks who would have thought a former game show host and failed business man would have been such a horrible failure as president casie mccall clayton you chose a known con man with a history of racism cheating lying filing multiple bankruptcies who has been accused of brags about unwanted sexual advances who thinks the rules dons apply to him who was given a million casie mccall clayton fighting for america exactly how please put the koolaid down casie mccall clayton until there are term limits it will be that way casie mccall clayton this was on a friends page an anguished question from a trump supporter why do liberals think trump supporters are stupid the serious answer heres what the majority of anti trump voters honestly feel about trump supporters en masse casie mccall clayton you think you do not think that is your biggest problem damon fehler you were obviously dropped on your face casie mccall clayton and f k you too casie mccall clayton name just one economic indicator that has improved since trump took office he got to this point by the dnc being sketchy af but i guess if the old sang holds true you cannot hate the player hate the game hope he wins or the world implodes 2020 zach miller are we upset i am wonder how the pussy grabbing pornstar adulterous reads like a 3rd grader temper tantrum man child got into office when the majority of america voted for hillary clinton why put the gang back in charge that lied to us all about the aca real cost based healthcare reform was set back a decade just say no to imperialist joe mitchell fellows so what you really want is trump again because that is what voting for kanye gets my guess is you are voting for trump and just being sarcastic which is oddly more respectable than actually voting for kanye because someone in the middle of a mania episode of bi polar disorder is a good choice just wait until the depression part hits i am not bashing people with mental illness but he really needs to stick to his meds he goes off the super deep end without them i feel sorry for him actually mitchell fellows kanye mitchell fellows how is the weather in moscow mitchell fellows god people will never understand the aca as it really was and i am tried off explaining it rydell downward has the flooding hit cengdu yet forget the polls too many people 41 9 relied on the polls in 2016 and here we are put on your masks wear the comfy shoes grab your umbrellas be late for work leave early from work if you did not vote last time then address the reason why this time and please get out there and make sure your voice counts jada love loveless i sat it out in 2016 because both hilary and trump were garbage but this time i will do whatever it takes to vote for biden mike galligan that cashier already had a better sense of morals mike i absolutely agree with you jada love loveless i am absolutely certain with a little basic training your neighborhood food lion cashier could do better than 80 of congress and the entire white house team polls are so you can let your guard down thinking your vote do not matter but it does matter go vote fill out the absentee ballot request return ballot asap best not to trust usps legal and fair voting locations will help call ask questions no such thing as a stupid question rebecca nave cling mail your ballots before november 9th still ignoring the fact he is in severe cognitive decline david rout yeah plenty to blame on both sides historically and present many mistakes yong park oh lord npr has really sheltered you from reality my friend yong park senate blocked os picks david helms no worse than trump and more than likely far better relatively speaking david helms yes they are that about balances out the trumpublican putin voter obstruction manipulation fraud obfuscation and divisive propaganda campaigns aimed ay illigitemately stealing another election vote like your life depends on it joe is an honorable compassionate leader who will do his level best to steer the ship of state out of rocky waters that is because president obama talked every moderate that was beating him to drop out of the race the fact that he only has an 11 point lead over trump perfectly illustrates his ineptitude i do not even want to know what the poll results are 538 had clinton winning by a huge margin right up until election night david leblond that is not true 538 consistently warned in the weeks before the election that other media outlets were overestimating clintons chances that the race was tighter than people thought and that trump had an electoral college advantage they had trumps odds of winning at three in ten which is not exactly a rare thing yup 538 had clinton up by 3 6 percent and the actual margin was 2 1 percent well within all margins of error paul murray exactly it is so tiresome this willful ignorance to misunderstand what polls are and mean it also helps that he has not had an unscripted interview since 2018 aww look i hurt its feelings jd backberg 11 2017 kevin howlett and trumps off script endless video phone a fox friend and tweets are proving he needs a padded room knock it off we can see the difference david rout the one who is cheating again is worse bidens campaign lacks the energy still hoping he will win just because he is not trump the corrupt con man who is just looking out for himself and if biden loses they will once again blame everyone but themselves for nominating an awful candidate the only reason biden has any chance at all in the general election is trump imagine how big a lead the democrats would have if they had not nominated a transitional president alex gross i am not a biden fan and would vote for a decent republican over biden but i will never give trump my vote so biden it is as trump would say what do i have to lose we made it through 4 years of trump we will survive 4 years of biden linda deka my exact same thoughts and feelings i will never believe polls again many trump supporters are too embarrassed to admit they are voting for him vote like you are up against a wannabe dictator who is willing to cheat cause we are stephanie striegel the shy or embarrassed trump voter that does not show up in polls is a myth hardy trenda lala right no one supporting trump at this point is going to change their mind but maybe there is enough undecided voters to make a difference paul murray it is hard to imagine any trump supporter staying silent paul murray glad to hear it stephanie striegel agreed you are right some people do not like trump but are still going to vote for him and they are keep their opinions to themselves my question is if you are too embarrassed to openly vote for someone then why in the heck are you voting for them sue greenhause thank you vote for your favorite pedophile does not matter if it is blue or red you will vote for a pedophile slaves gail cain me too every day this is definitely the election of our lifetime hardy trenda lala it is funny because he hates everyone but loves manipulating people to make them think he is our their side stephanie striegel i agree with you about not trusting polls but i think it is more likely people who voted for trump before are more likely not to want to admit that and are are either voting for biden not voting for president at all or writing someone in gail cain goes both ways i have family members who unfriended me because i do not share their liberal views not once did i tell them i was right what made them mad is i did not say they were right this is funny npr pbs does the poll that is not even close to being a non partisan poll why not get the dnc to do the poll tex gill it is a marsists poll which is a well respected independent polling company you would know that if you did even a smidge of research before commenting they are not just calling the people who send them money and actually pbs and npr are not biased clearly you do not understand how polling works look into it it is interesting take an introductory measurement and statistics course for senior citizens like you they are usually free to audit at a state university or community college and you do not have to meet the admissions requirements paul murray besides gallup is busy with a new girlfriend marist works harder and has not had a date since 97 rocky he was handed the nomination leaandrea johnson yes handed as in won by several million votes leaandrea johnson the fix was in the dnc did it last go round to bernie too the voters picked biden over bernie the ones who dropped out would have only diluted both their numbers and prolonged the primary it was a smart tactical move and tactical thinking is what we expect of political parties intent on winning elections troy carpenter so it was the voters that dropped out and endorsed him a day or so before super tuesday troy carpenter so you agree the party tactically rigged the election rocky road as in ice cream maybe they handed him the nomination despite several debate appearances that left most of us wondering why a desperate move to stop the progressives perhaps they were right perhaps biden will do better against trump than sanders would have done but rocky road hardly obama convinced the other candidates who were leading biden to drop out to stop u s senator bernie sanders ryan cab exactly npr reporters getting paid for full articles when the story is one sentence long ryan cab are we reading the same thing i think the title is referring to looking for obamas endorsement i do not see anything that obama pressured candidates to drop out am i missing something here michael hollrigel see more i hope the biden campaign does not get complacent the current president will lie steal and cheat to win matt marano even if he does win we must insist there was lying cheating and stealing matt marano he is already lying cheating and stealing matt marano biden and his son set a great standard alana bowdridge please try harder a shanfully dnc trick to kick out bernie antenor martin aleman ramirez are you saying that bernie did not pull out of his own choice no time to be complacent there are those debates and the issue of turnout it is a long time yet and the dangerous part for biden begins now do not become complacent we need every single vote we need a blue tsunami to let the criminals know they are through biden and the dnc do not wayne wilkinson your profile indicates that you drink a lot that probably explains it the dnc screwed bernie sanders again and handed the nomination to the much inferior candidate biden everyone else dropped out the night before super tuesday not a very long story kailee bringedahl great choreography nothing is the same about 2016 bro bro please it is a different election hillary was not polling as well back then bro you gotta vote blue no matter who bro please the democratic establishment is not flagrantly ignoring and diminishing the voices of the left and youth once again it is a different election bro please you just gotta try a different more conservative and pro corporate strain of politician bro please vote blue pedophile they are better than red pedophile chris finestone you should look into the electoral college you seem to misunderstand how all this actually works joe bidens long and rocky road to the nursing home there i fixed it for you general kindness thatll get you pretty far even in todays hate tornado we are all trying to survive because the establishment said it would be biden no matter how unenthusiastic majority of voters where about him progressives knew this before it even started it was not our first rodeo with the dnc after bernie took the early lead in the first hope you are going to vote blue josh christopher rigged bryce evans thank you for that sure i agree with that josh christopher cannot lose to the worst candidate in history if you are the worst candidate in history lmfao keep drinking that kool aid he is the same exact position clinton was in at the same point in 2016 this is not about me in a nice safe coastal state ian thomas dooley huge difference here ian thomas dooley hillary is not running ian thomas dooley yes he is he is a republican light centrist that is never done much of anything good in his long career in politics ian thomas dooley incorrect trump was much closer to clinton in 2016 some polls even had him ahead also clinton had record breaking disapproval ratings for a dem candidate more than 50 bidens is less than 50 it does not matter when election time comes trump will win biden would be a disaster to this county alex lopez why do people put so much into polls hillary had a 16 point lead according to the polls and that meant squat

We had a paper mill shut down here where I live... On the river, off the interstate, has it's own rail feed. Talked with windmill manufacturing out of Gainesville TX, asked if they expanded at all, ad‚Ä¶See More. Electromagnetism is your future energy drive, earthlings. Embrace it in its simplicity or count down your inevitable destruction.. Jay Douglas Why not.  The way they reproduce.  Kind of like 'War of the Worlds' with Tom Cruise and those alien machines.. Jay Douglas sorry. Imagine driving your car into public pond or lake and just leaving it there. You'd probably be arrested and fined, but when it comes to oil tankers it's ok because 'you use petroleum products, right ?'. Roxlau Islais it wasn‚Äôt an oil tanker.. Roxlau Islais imaging if people would read an article before commenting.. Japan should take transparent ecological responsibility for this disaster in terms of compensation to that county and individual residents of the local area affected.. Japan... east asia is not all the same place. August Kersten Japan üáØüáµ!. As with many nations of Japan‚Äôs stature in the global community they will no doubt stay silent.. Andy Buck do you demonstrate idiocy every day or only when you don‚Äôt read an article. This is a cargo ship and the company that manages it is doing the cleanup. Perhaps read an article before you demonstrate bigotry and ignorance in the same comment.. Japan is still leaking nuclear waste if I‚Äôm not mistaken.  They continue to wreak havoc Globally..... Breaking: American complains about Japan‚Äôs use of nuclear technology. Lol @ reek. Erik Weston it wasn't the Japanese that made Hiroshima or Nagasaki radioactive.... It‚Äôs not being collected and stored like the stuff at Hanford which leaks a tiny bit as storage tanks degrade. Raquel Leiva Fukushima didn‚Äôt happen??. Raquel Leiva actually it kind of depends on how you look at it- if Japan hadn‚Äôt killed millions of people and tried to take over half of the world- Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not have been bombed.. Ok yeah Japan is slacking, wtf?. Greg Diebold your fundamental lack of historical understanding is a bit disturbing and completely off topic.. Who owns it? I feel like there‚Äôs been a deliberate move away from identifying the owners. Have they even said who actually owns the oil and the ship? Who‚Äôs responsible for cleaning up this oil?. human beings are the worst thing to ever happen to the planet.  the sooner we go extinct the better. There's just no learning when it comes to oil transport.  It's the definition of insanity.. Georgia Willis  that literally is not the definition of insanity. It‚Äôs a misattributed quote from Einstein that can‚Äôt even be validated as Einstein‚Äôs quote... because he didn‚Äôt say it. I really wish it would go away üôÉ. Georgia Willis you‚Äôre awful condescending for someone who didn‚Äôt read the article.. Matt Smolich I don't see Einstein mentioned in Georgia's remark. ü§î. I wouldn‚Äôt care if Japan went bankrupt cleaning up this f@&$)(; mess.. Julie Anne 1. It‚Äôs practically nothing compared to other oil spills. 2. You can‚Äôt clean it up once it disperses.. Julie Anne The boat was registered to a shell company in Panama, so technically  Japan isn't responsible.. Fine and arrest the owner of the ship!!. Josh Bell why? It was an accident, and not a foreseeable one.. How come we haven't taken more precautions for transporting oil? This has happened enough that you would think we'd change our system... anybody have any suggestions? Unfortunately this is out of my scope of practice.. Saige Lucas Castellanos why don‚Äôt you read the article?. Saige Lucas Castellanos they weren‚Äôt transporting oil, it was a cargo ship.  The oil/fuel and hydronic fluid is for the operation of the ship.. David McLeod Because I'm an American and don't read lol jk but for real, I understand accidents happen but we need a new system to prevent incidents like this.. Oil, radioactive material, overfishing... Japan loves the ocean.. Joseph Stark oh a second moronic comment, you‚Äôre 2 for 2, would you like to go for a third?. David McLeod a ship snapping in half is not an accident, it is negligence.... David McLeod rather than resorting to insults, would you explain why it was not a forseeable accident? They choose a poor route through a highly sensitive area they shouldn‚Äôt have been in to begin with.. 'Worst ecological disaster in the country's history' is misleading, since Mauritius has only been a country since 1968. The ship sinkings in the region during the Second World War dwarf this accident by orders of magnitude.. 'Worst ecological disaster' slipped right past you. War is not a 'ecological disaster' . Ralph, oh man, this is what got you all worked up??Priorities buddy.. Nah, it's a slow news day, Tim üòÉ At least I'm not arguing that an ecological disaster is a disaster caused by the environment, or whatever that fool was trying to prove üòÉ. Ronald Auther he‚Äôs talking about all the oil going down with this ships.. Nothing outlasts the destruction of 2020. It keeps going and going and going.... Whoa. Exxon-like malfeasance again. The Valdez spill in Alaska. This is another long enduring horror.. Sacilliyah Yves Walker not even remotely, it was a cargo ship that ran into a reef, not an easily foreseeable or preventable thing.. We all know that fossil fuel is bad but who really cares as long as it run our car and everything we need. Tomorrow we will ship more and more. They weren‚Äôt shipping it as you say, they were using it as fuel, which is currently the only option for moving cargo ships unless you prefer nuclear power. Even then they will have tons of oil-based lubricants and such on board.. David McLeod its a Fuel oil right?. Japan should clean it up ASAP. Such a nuisance leaving it like that!!. Mauritius, for those not keeping track of extinctions, was the home of the Dodo bird. It no longer is, because the Dutch just killed them all after they got there.. There goes all the Amazon delivery vetoes !. If Krammerico had only won their patent.. This is devastating.  The lemon juice in the gaping wound that is 2020.. still, we continue to make the same mistakes over and over again and again,why?. Fabrizio Montanar Profit for some.. Fabrizio Montanar money and convenience. Because no one has locked down the country of origin registration and Panama and Liberia make it so easy.         If it were more difficult,  the cruise ships would actually operate out of their home country and be responsible for their actions.   It's only the environmental disasters that have us question the shipping industry.. We have got to stop using fossil fuel.  Enough of big oil oligarchies.. Joe Morrow the only other option for moving large cargo ships is nuclear if you‚Äôre fine with that.. *Brought to you by Samsung Galaxy. An item that is made up of minerals and fossil fuels. Where‚Äôs the UN! They need to force country like Japan to clean up!. where are the hasmat wearing clean-up crews???????? what phenomenal irresponsibility. the planet is dying from pollution and this???? W T F ?. What does run aground mean? What caused the split and how long did it take to split? Thanks for the info in advance y'all.. Wind and solar would not do that!. Josephine Montoya wind and solar would not move a cargo ship of that size.. To be fair... That is an *awesome* photo.. An ounce of prevention, is worth a pound of cure üò¢. Mauritius depends on the sea, too.. Leave the oil in the ground!!. Send Japan the bill for all associated cost.. Where is the Japanese company  that owns the ship? Can't they launch a recovery and cleanup?. Where is Japan? Why aren't they handling this?. Get ready to foot a BIG bill, Japan.. Japan needs to fix this and give restitition immediately.. all those boats Japan has killing whales 'for science' and they can't even take care of their fleet. Michael Vilabrera dolt. One wonders where allegiances are these days.. But windmills cause cancer. Jamie DeFelice. Jamie DeFelice No, it is blatant Whataboutism, muffin mellons. üòâ. Charles Roberts. Charles Roberts it's satire sugar tits. WTF üáØüáµ clean this disaster up!. How did it leak 1000 tons and they have collected 1250 tons? If they literally collected more than had spilled then how is this a major ecological disaster?  Something is wrong here.. Good that it split!  It will never be able to dump oil again! Japanese ocean polluters!. 2020 - the hits keep coming. The gulf spill has taught us that nature has a way of handling these spills. So Fukushima was what??.. Sara Brown worst ecological disaster in Mauritius' history, not Japan's.. This is why my daughter (20) said she is never having kids. What kind of planet are we leaving for them? 2020 - the hits just keep on coming... üòî. Which country‚Äôs history. Hang them all.

Stop electing this kind of world killer please, we all suffer through the planet because of Americans inconsequent votes.. It's intensely hot across Northern California and we had a 2 hour long episode of high winds and dry lightning last night. Really does not bode well for preventing wildfires.

So sad for Northern California.  here in Southern CA we are having fires, but these Fire Tornadoes are another level of danger. They had them in the Carr fire 2 years ago. Please keep them in your thoughts!. I remember hearing about them then.  Fires bi enough and intense enough to create their own weather systems.  So incredibly frightening!.

julie wia we have left a note for our mail carrier on the outside of our mailbox letting them know how much we appreciate what they do krysia witkowski i have been thinking we should do that so that is what i am going to do krysia witkowski i am a retired mail carrier your carrier will appreciate your thinking of him well i just found out through fb that the guy working at my local post office is a total trump supporter and is all in with no voting by mail of course they could make an orange trump stamp for 1c alternatively we could all just pay a dollar each for stamps and be rid of him by mail in ballot it will be the best value for money ever hey and do not forget other governmental agencies require one to have a legal mail address irs getting your passport or that all of congress gets free franked mail we all need rely on usps trevor your funny and i like everything about your show and you how present the facts i am just pissed at how we have become so broken over dumbtrump the united states post office needs to be saved from this awful bullshit i appricate my post man and woman because sometimes we get 2 people delivering mail i need my mail this so wrong on so many levels trump said he would fund it if he got what he wants in the rest of the bill i think that is bribery use volunteers to deliver mail in ballets to ballot boxes and as long as they are volunteering there is nothing the orange man can do about it because it is not causing him a dime or any of his time there is nothing he can do to volunteers guys it cannot be safely done so just drop

Are you going to tell me that you have no relatives that have ever got hooked on something.  Even though he was on drugs, he got a law degree.  Biden taught his son a work ethic.. Kellene Neering OMG no point wasting my time on you!. Lydia Vanderwalker, you should re-read my post. I'm pointing out that having an addict in the family isn't a disqualification for being POTUS.. Bone spurs? What are you talking about . Biden‚Äôs son failed a drug test twice and was removed. Oh and Biden shouldn‚Äôt be president because he can‚Äôt complete a sentence . Maybe thirty years ago but he is also a molester and creep. He has been hanging around for 50 years and has done nothing what makes you Biden supporters think he has anything new?. Rita Dalessio so true!. Dave Garland  OMG!. MaryJanice Davidson what about the guy who got fired while he and his son waited. Dan Siegfried tRump has known for over 5 weeks that putin put bounties on your friends sons and daughters and did Nothing....if you support tRump you are a traitor by proxy!. Dave Cunningham oh there‚Äôs plenty there. It‚Äôs been swept under the rug. Rita Dalessio Sure, elect the best of two evils.. I did.  I attended his book signing  He spoke of his son, family but also of his political career. There was so much about him I didn‚Äôt know  this was before he was officially a candidate. I was extremely impressed and left thinking what a man of character and political accomplishments. 50 years in office and still we don't know what he stands for. ü§î. Jean Caton in all the years in government he has done nothing. Jean Caton what accomplishments?. Sheila Cassata sounds like you are describing Trump.. Jeffrey Eskew do your homework. Jean Caton  lol. Sheila Cassata. Byron Branyon  That sounds computer generated also.. Timothy Pueyo To me it just sounds like she knows how to write well.. He‚Äôs a good man.  I am fine with supporting him. He will restore competence and integrity to our government and clearly do a better job managing the pandemic.. Never accomplished anything worth while only for himself and his family. Made them rich.Talks a good talk.. I think he‚Äôs a great man! No person serving the public for 40 years plus is free from errors and bad policy decisions (no one is perfect including myself and you - Joe/ Jane Voter) but he is the President we need for this country if we want salvage whatever humanity we have left in the US.  #BidenHarris2020. She is right. When it comes to hard-knocking political issues like the coronavirus and the economy, Joe Biden will do anything to beat Trump in November. He cares about us. He has citizenship, respect and honesty for all of us. That is why I am happy to vote for Biden and Kamala.. Compassion, intelligence, experience, morals....so ready to get back to that after this destructive mess we‚Äôve been in.. Agree... there has been no guidance, humanity, Hope or decency for three years. It‚Äôs what has made us fighting angry with each other, made us feel hopeless and lost in this pandemic, and no empathy for those who have lost lives so that our world can‚Äôt recover. We have been made a house divided by conspiracy theories, namecalling, fear and veiled threats.. How many decades on the taxpayers' dime with little accomplishment, add in the accusations by Tara Reade which fell off the radar despite reassurances that 'all women should be believed' along with rapidly declining faculties...love him, don't vote for him. He's dedicated his life to public service and helping the common person. He has empathy and compassion for us. He cares about us. I am happy to vote for him and Kamala.. He is a decent, compassionate human being. He is intelligent enough to place the appropriate people in the right positions. Through his administration, the US can regain its position of respect in the world. We will move forward for the well being of the American people. Pretty simple..

Great grandmother Betty Spears was unable to mark the occasion with her treasured family and son-in-law Kevin, because of tight restrictions protecting residents at the home. St Judes Nursing Home, in Sutton, Surrey, proudly claims to be one of the only virus-free care homes in the area. Despite this, the team were determined to recognize Betty‚Äôs big day, and pay tribute to your joyous character and young spirit. Nurses pampered Betty, herself a former nurse, with beauty treatments and decorated the home in her honor before holding a special 107th birthday party full of singing and laughter.","Happy Birthday! Wish your family was with you, maybe next year and more after that!God bless you, young lady.Thank you to the staff that gave her this special day.. Seniors and elderly in homes and ALF should be allow to see thier families with precautions They are deteriorating quickly and passing away from the loneliness.. What a shame. Surely the family could've worn relevant ppe so to share even an hour with her...Hope she had a fab day though. Happy birthday Betty.x. Cruelty in the name of Covid. First of all her family is more important to her thsn a birthday party. Dhe had over 100 of them. Now too family members could be tested for the virus so you took the easy way out and forsaken her own familyWhat is it about Covid that has made prople lose their minds or are on power trips.. If that many workers can be there, celebrating, her family could have been there instead!!!. Happy Birthday Betty Spears !To all the people who commented, she lives in England.. I live in a beautiful assisted living facility, but have been in quarantine since March 20...although I did play hooky for 4 days in July. After that, I was quarantined in my apartment for 2 weeks...meanwhile, all residents were quarantined and asked n‚Ä¶See More. Happy birthday but if all those employees could have brought in covid-19 then they should have allowed your family. I think she should have been able to spend what could be her last birthday with her family and friends. Happy birthday Betty.. Betty‚Äôs family should have been able to see her and celebrate Betty‚Äôs Birthday together!. Treasured family and son-in-law Kevin... So, Kevin's not treasured? ü•∫üòÇüòú. Happy birthday, Betty. I'm truly ashamed at the sick people on this post that would turn this post into a foul mean spirited political bashing. Grow up and grow some manners.. Her son in law was there, she did see him, if her children are still alive they'd be in their 80's most likely, so at risk also. Fox just twisted the story to poke you all. https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/.../18630207.sutton.../It was nearly a fortnight ago anyway.. Bless her heart! But if the nursing staff can be there the family should be there. Not all the staff needed to there. I think it‚Äôs shameful she should have been surround by loved ones not staff.. This plandemic is killing seniors in these care facilities. No social interaction is the worst for them. This is nothing but an overblown flu. These seniors are suffering mentally now. Six months in to this plandemic and we just sent one out because of‚Ä¶See More. This is so sad and wrong.  All those people there in close proximity and they would not allow her family in.  Workers are bringing it in to nursing home residents all over the country, it‚Äôs not like they are leaving to get it themselves.. She's 107, for God's sake, make a safe room for her family to visit, even a tent outside. That's just cruel.. This is news but shooting of a 5 year old in the head wasn't. You guys need some priorities.. A nursing home patient being barred from seeing her relatives sounds a lot like illegal false imprisonment to me. No reason this woman can't see her relatives.. Happy Birthday to Betty Spears !! My mother was a Spears ...great name !!. Should have been able to spend it with family masked and distanced even thru a window or outside.Just my opinion.. Happy birthday!!When I end up in a nursing home my kids have strict orders to brake me out if we ever get locked down. I would rather die with my loved ones that live the few years I would have left, apart from them.. This is sickening! This BS has to stop. Wtf??? These workers have been the reason covid has killed the elderly in the past. This is about liability insurance  and money, NOT protecting grandma. People need to rise up.. This makes me so sad üòû family should be able to see them, if all I need to do to go to work is have my temp checked and a mask, the same should go with families!. Family should have been invited or outdoors so could have came 6 ft distance.. Nursing homes turned out to be death cells because of their lack of considerations towards health safety measures. Sorry but the elderly were better off in empty vegas hotels. Should take her out and move her into their own home. This isn‚Äôt right. Probably don‚Äôt want to care for her.. Happy birthday Great grandmother Betty Spears.. Happy Birthday! Hoping your day was filled with joy!. The saliva tests now being used at University of Illinois Urbana get results within 5 hrs. Imagine what a difference this would make for all nursing homes. Hope SOMEONE is paying attention.. It seems like overkill to deny her a visit on this very special birthday!!Why can't they let them wear protective covering life me nurses wear and of course a mask??!!Who knows if she'll be around until you allow visitors!!. Beautiful Betty. May you have a blessed birthday.. Wouldn‚Äôt want to be that old.  Everyone you would have known would be dead.. But I thought masks worked?? I guess another lie perpetrated by the liberals. üòë. So wrong not to have family there!. Her family should have been there.. Did someone say nursing home. Her loved ones should be around!. For your birthday my face is yours to sit on l. Why didn't they have them visit her outside of the window behind her?. Hey Fox News. What‚Äôs wrong now that you don‚Äôt allow any photos in the comments section. Are you joining all the other propaganda news stations not wanting truth out to the public?. America: IT'S JUST A FLU. Happy 107th Birthday Betty! I am so very sorry that you are still being forbidden from being with your family.. Why couldn't her family wear masks also?. Why are old age homes? Shame. She's going to die without seeing her family. What is there to celebrate? Live and die without seeing her family? Or live and die seeing her family.....?. Man its so happy to hear good news like this.. Do the workers live in covid-free bubbles outside of work? No!!! Ms. Betty‚Äôs family should have been there.. So the workers who go home to their families. The workers who you don‚Äôt know who they are in contact with outside of the facility. The workers. Strangers got to celebrate this women‚Äôs life and her family could not.  This is unbelievable crapüò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°.

Every city is major city is feeling the crime wave... it seems to be only getting worse... my city has multiple separate shootings a night now we‚Äôre much smaller than. Cinci.... Remember the panic when you couldn‚Äôt find toilet paper. Wait til you can‚Äôt find a police officer. Hate will help clean earth up in the long run.  The more people that go away from earth the better for the environment.. Wonder if those were all black on black since their lives matter so much to each other.. And not one person was shot by the police.  The police are backing down.  Be careful what you wish for !!. Social ills of having almost everyone with the gun with weak laws; the laws should be reviewed.. Wow!! We are so ‚ÄúGreat Again ‚Äú!! Doesn‚Äôt everyone want four more years of this?!!. Another uncontrollable city run by Democrats,  and they want to control the United states. COMING TO A CITY NEAR YOU.   PEOPLE get your head out of the sand, this will continue and effect every city and town,. It‚Äôs like hearing Mondays on which movie did the best in box office. But now it‚Äôs which city had the most shootings. Sad reality. Looks like social distancing and mask wearing are working out great. The sooner we can get #45 out of office, the sooner we can get back to normal!!!. Another good reason not to visit Chicago.. Wow. Cinci usually a pretty calm city Is this crap expanding If so someone needs to but a boot on the neck of this rebellion. Just a preview of more to come with the libtards supporting all of it by undermining our men/women in blue. The problem isn‚Äôt 45, it‚Äôs liberals raising children.  They are growing up now and don‚Äôt like hearing no, you can‚Äôt have this or that.  They are having tantrums because life hit square in the face and they don‚Äôt like having to earn their living.. I always said the good people  of theses citys. Should rise up with force and put the rollers on them  that kill and dedtroy..dont need them in your citys. Stand up people... Where are the community activist when you need them?. Nice job to all you Democrats in Cincinnati !. This is exactly why we need to defund the police #blm. Nothing good happens after midnight.  So much for quarantine...Or are these gangs ESSENTIAL?. Maybe if they wore a mask?. So if we look at historical records, violence, abortion, are the dnc policies intent on destroying blacks in America?. And how could a social worker handle this?! All this violence and murdering and the liberals want to cut police funding. If anything they need to increase it!. There you go.. keep voting for Democrats.. it's only going to get worse... Every neighborhood listed has a high rate of black on black crime and drug-infested. Thanks for the lack of details Fox.. This is what happens in democrat controlled cities. I tuned into WKRP in Cincinnati, less Nessman reporting that helicopters were flying over the city dropping frozen turkeys. Sounds like a big huge mess. Question is what distraction is this for? Chicago has this on a daily. This isn't LAW-ABIDING Gun Owners....these are criminals who have guns....BIG DEFFERENCE.. If it isn‚Äôt reported on WKRP I won‚Äôt believe it.. BLM is enroute to investigate.... That Defund the Police is really working ... huh left?. All you guys screaming about Democrats this and and Democrats did that need to quit crying and slap yourself. Where‚Äôs Kasich? Mr Fence Sitter.. Another democrat run city, can you say you are surprised at this?. Where is Snake Plissken when you need him?. Another beautiful night under democrat rule.. Black lives really matter, lmfao! The hypocrisy is hilarious at best.. Soooon what do any of these incidents have to do with George floyd and the moves to change policing? Or was that just thrown in there to fool the ideologues who wanted to hear about that stuff? Sounds like a poor attempt at manipulating public opinion with elementary propaganda.

city‚Äôs law enforcement officers. They‚Äôve been put through the ringer now for months with no gratitude! üôè. Lori McArthur Brewer I don‚Äôt know how they take the abuse. I would have already been fired. People throwing rocks would get the right back.. Tina Davis a LOT of restraint, definitely. Thankless job. Lori McArthur Brewer. carrying out trumps race war!. Lori McArthur Brewer pretty sure beating up civilians is a clear indication they don‚Äôt have ANY restraint. This needs to stop now! We need our police. We can rid our police departments of the few bad cops. What we don‚Äôt need EVER are rioters and looters!. Patrice Davis Hoover time cull them. Shut up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1JZKZWSCu8. Patrice Davis Hoover not a few bad cops... let's start @ 50% bad 50% ok, let's start there and we can talk. These portland police officers are some of the toughest, most courageous people that I have ever seen. Theopolis comes to mind.. Like I‚Äôve said time & time again.....the city let the police down by making the federal agents leave.  If they would‚Äôve let them stay & take out the trash aka protesters, the police could do their regular job.  Unfortunately, the innocent people are being overlooked because of the incompetence of the city council!  Come on Oregonians WAKE UP!. The entire city should get together and sue the people that are letting this happen. That‚Äôs awesome and they still keep letting it happen. The stupidity of the left and liberals is through the roof and they will just keep voting them in. It will never get better until the ‚Äúright‚Äù gets involved. If they voted them they are getting what they deserve the Darwin effect is taking place.. If they ever loved that city, they need to re-elect the guy to start knocking some heads!  Right now his hands are tied.  At this point, I‚Äôm sure they find issue with the brand of toothpaste he uses!!!!  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Is this even a surprise? The residents of Portland deserve better than this. Those who voted in (and continue to support) the derelict mayor/officials of the city should realize you can‚Äôt have it both ways. You want to defund the police? Yet still call them the moment you realize you‚Äôve got no one else? Sickening. Way to go! Elected Officials are a Disgrace. Vote Red or this will be in every single city in the US. God Bless and Protect those who serve.üá∫üá∏. I live 2 hours south of Portland. Our govenor is useless and doesn't care. However, the rest of us have to make sure we have our masks on or face a $1,000 fine. Oregon is one of the worst places to live in the country. High taxes, high unemployment, terrible school system, housing costs are ridiculous, etc. etc. etc.. Hopefully Oregon will be waking up from this, and realize that voting blue has been destroying them. They will turn into a red state.. And yet the marxist leaders of this failed city claim that Federal officers were the problem. And what happened when they left? These rioters barricade a police building with people inside and tried to burn them alive. This isn't protesting, its viol‚Ä¶See More. This is why we MUST have gun rightsüëä Defensive measures are necessary, when the government you pay to protect you messes up their one job.... LMAO. People of Portland get what they tolerate. Feel free to recall your mayor and the rest of the city council. The ones in control aren't doing chit for law abiding citizens.. Hmmm....  Looks like Oregon has a real handle on serving the people who contact 911.  Nice going, Oregon.  I hope your residents remember you at the ballot box...  Karma..... They voted their local government in and now they need to pay the price.  Let‚Äôs see what happens in the next one.  No sympathies here.. The taxpayers in Portland deserve better if they really do need to quit voting Democrat. One of my friends used to call Oregon, God's Country. Well the devil has wrecked that.. Pride the citizens of this city will wise up and vote Republican. Can't have it both ways. Sorry for those that didn't want any of this. Get out and vote in Nov.. Portland has done this to itself. Decisions are not without consequences.. My heart goes out to the people of Portland put at risk by these protestors.  I hope that vote the crap out of that city.. Keep voting blue and your whole life will be unheeded ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Giving them no support, take away their defense and cut the budget what exactly did you expect to happen !. It must suck to live there , and I live in Chicago , so I feel and understand the pain of all this none sense ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. If any 911 call that couldn't be handled ends up with severe consequences, any one charged with rioting during that time should be charged with some degree of hindering aid.. Aren‚Äôt we defunding the police? What‚Äôs the problem? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Actions have consequences...voting for democrats for example.. all police should take a month of and leave the rioters to it.city council should respond with their social workers. Sadly, it's what Portlanders get for voting in libtards. And, keeping them. They can change it.. If I were the police union I‚Äôd be organizing a nationwide strike. Enough is enough.. That‚Äôs what they get for defunding the police. They deserve it because they voted for whoever in charge.. ‚ÄúGood luck with that‚Äù- Oregon State Police. It is an ongoing futile situation, because of inept liberal democrats taking their cues from the Washington D.C. inept liberal democrats.. Law abiding citizens need to ban together and run their mayor, DA and everyone else in charge out of town.. Did they send out unarmed social workers instead? üòÇ. Sorry Portland but you elected officials who won't stand up to rioters and anarchists. I don't feel bad for you at all. You voted for socialists and this is what you got. Have you learned anything yet?. Time for some water cannons!!!. Where is the Community Services Resource Strike Force Team?. That‚Äôs your future Portland unless you get your act together.. defund the police, so why should they respond???. Stand with Trump and take our country back!!!!. The beautiful PNW city Portland destroyed by the left. Very sad.. Hopefully the people of Oregon will wake up.. Portland, one of the first cities to fall.. Cops should stage a walk out and sit back and watch the city burn. Then pull all federal money out of the state and tell‚Äôem good luck.. Go Bill Barr!!! They messed up for disrespecting you the way they did in that hearing. Pain coming.. Have the people of Portland learned their lesson for electing democrats?. Wonder how those people of the 60 emergency calls to 911 now feel about defunding the police  and their citiy leaders.. This is a shameful disgrace. The Army, not the national guard needs to take control of that city and treat hostile combatants like they normally do. And then the useless fringe weirdo local left politicians can debate over who gets to bury all the dead so they can continue to feel involved..

hoover not a few bad cops let us start 50 bad 50 ok let us start there and we can talk these portland police officers are some of the toughest most courageous people that i have ever seen theopolis comes to mind like i have said time time again the city let the police down by making the federal agents leave if they would have let them stay take out the trash aka protesters the police could do their regular job unfortunately the innocent people are being overlooked because of the incompetence of the city council come on oregonians wake up the entire city should get together and sue the people that are letting this happen that is awesome and they still keep letting it happen the stupidity of the left and liberals is through the roof and they will just keep voting them in it will never get better until the right gets involved if they voted them they are getting what they deserve the darwin effect is taking place if they ever loved that city they need to re elect the guy to start knocking some heads right now his hands are tied at this point i am sure they find issue with the brand of toothpaste he uses is this even a surprise the residents of portland deserve better than this those who voted in and continue to support the derelict mayor officials of the city should realize you cannot have it both ways you want to defund the police yet still call them the moment you realize you have got no one else sickening way to go elected officials are a disgrace vote red or this will be in every single city in the us god bless and protect those who serve i live 2 hours south of portland our govenor is useless and does not care however the rest of us have to make sure we have our masks on or face a 1 000 fine oregon is one of the worst places to live in the country high taxes high unemployment terrible school system housing costs are ridiculous etc etc etc hopefully oregon will be waking up from this and realize that voting blue has been destroying them they will turn into a red state and yet the marxist leaders of this failed city claim that federal officers were the problem and what happened when they left these rioters barricade a police building with people inside and tried to burn them alive this is not protesting its this is why we must have gun rights defensive measures are necessary when the government you pay to protect you messes up their one job lmao people of portland get what they tolerate feel free to recall your mayor and the rest of the city council the ones in control are not doing chit for law abiding citizens hmmm looks like oregon has a real handle on serving the people who contact 911 nice going oregon i hope your residents remember you at the ballot box karma they voted their local government in and now they need to pay the price let us see what happens in the next one no sympathies here the taxpayers in portland deserve better if they really do need to quit voting democrat one of my friends used to call oregon gods country well the devil has wrecked that pride the citizens of this city will wise up and vote republican cannot have it both ways sorry for those that did not want any of this get out and vote in nov portland has done this to itself decisions are not without consequences my heart goes out to the people of portland put at risk by these protestors i hope that vote the crap out of that city keep voting blue and your whole life will be unheeded giving them no support take away their defense and cut the budget what exactly did you expect to happen it must suck to live there and i live in chicago so i feel and understand the pain of all this none sense if any 911 call that could not be handled ends up with severe consequences any one charged with rioting during that time should be charged with some degree of hindering aid are not we defunding the police what is the problem actions have consequences voting for democrats for example all police should take a month of and leave the rioters to it city council should respond with their social workers sadly it is what portlanders get for voting in libtards and keeping them they can change it if i were the police union i would be organizing a nationwide strike enough is enough that is what they get for defunding the police they deserve it because they voted for whoever in charge good luck with that oregon state police it is an ongoing futile situation because of inept liberal democrats taking their cues from the washington d c inept liberal democrats law abiding citizens need to ban together and run their mayor da and everyone else in charge out of town did they send out unarmed social workers instead sorry portland but you elected officials who will not stand up to rioters and anarchists i do not feel bad for you at all you voted for socialists and this is what you got have you learned anything yet time for some water cannons where is the community services resource strike force team that is your future portland unless you get your act together defund the police so why should they respond stand with trump and take our country back the beautiful pnw city portland destroyed by the left very sad hopefully the people of oregon will wake up portland one of the first cities to fall cops should stage a walk out and sit back and watch the city burn then pull all federal money out of the state and tellem good luck go bill barr they messed up for disrespecting you the way they did in that hearing pain coming have the people of portland learned their lesson for electing democrats wonder how those people of the 60 emergency calls to 911 now feel about defunding the police and their citiy leaders this is a shameful disgrace the army not the national guard needs to take control of that city and treat hostile combatants like they normally do and then the useless fringe weirdo local left politicians can debate over who gets to bury all the dead so they can continue to feel involved i believe both portland and seattle are trying to recall their mayors ,"['portland', 'city', 'police', 'oregon', 'people', 'get', 'voting', 'one', 'strike', 'vote', 'job', 'consequences', 'law', 'left',

There is no Law & Order in Chicago. All of the good people & the Police should head to Republican States.. the mayor of Chicago is worthless!!!!.

Joseph Brown i dont think its the citys duty to keep every business safe. Thats why stores pony up for security guards. Alessandro Valignano by this logic all of Colorado is Antifa along with other states that provide it for medical use. Most people that use pot are so laid back they have trouble getting off the couch, much less going out to riot. Blaming pot for everything may make you feel better, but it's not reality. Do some research, enlighten your sheltered mind.. Joseph Brown REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER TRUST TRUMP , NOT AGAIN. ‚Ä¶See More. Amanda Williams It is the city's responsibility to pay for the damage when they don't support the police and officers that would've stopped this. Since the mayor told police to stand down, who should've stopped this?. Right.  We have to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù towards our fellow man by wearing a mask and distancing, at the SAME time people are attacking others and their businesses.. Kathleen Ziska Terlizzi its a must for us to do so.But here in Africa we dont take this virus serious. Sue the city big time! That is the only way things will change--if it hits the city money wise.  Go for it, get a huge settlement.. Yes please! Sue the city big time for allowing this to happen! (Breach of duty by these so-called leaders) These people are trying to work and survive... Stealing is stealing! No excuse!. The city will probably charge the shop owner for having glass on the sidewalk. That's what they did in minneapolis..charged a business burned to the ground $3k for a fence the city out up around the rubble. So much lawlessness, we need to stop defunding law enforcement!. This was not stopped by the mayor or govenor. Time for everyone to take a stand in all that they have worked so hard for. However it will take a long time since nothing was done in the beginning when it should have.. Good. I hope they all sue. It's a breach of duty by these so-called leaders and they need to be held accountable!. More business owners and people who have had their property destroyed or threatened should sue the city and the state,.. ALL the business owners should sue that mayor! And it should happen in every city that has had looting & destruction.. Good , they allowed this to happen . You have a right as an American citizen to be protected. Absolutely correct to sue the city.  The mayor is shameful.. 2nd Amendment should take care of that real quick if people would learn how to defend themselves!. Hope you sue for lots , you deserve every penny because Chicago fired  police that are supposed to be there to protect their citizens. Be STRONG and BEST OF LUCK !üëçüôèüëç. This is the America of the Democrats and that‚Äôs exactly why our Great President Trump Will Indeed Win Big Time. Good Day and God bless.. As he should. The Mayor should also be held criminally liable. Ordering the police to stand down should make you an accessory to the crime.. I don't  know what officials are planning but whatever ...it is NOT working to protect their citizens and their ability to own and run their business. I don't  think they have mental capacity to govern.. Sue them... they failed to do their jobs as elected officials.  Unfortunately, these officials are immune to lawsuits.. the process takes time and before you know it... they are out of office or there's another distraction.... FORCE THEM ALL OUT OF OFFICE.. All the stores need to leave and let the mayor deal with it seeing she is not helping stop this. As well he should.  The Mayor has done absolutely nothing to stop anarchy.. Sue the mayor who allowed the anarchists and looters to stay. Sounds like they need to infuse the police with funds instead of defunding...it's a shame. Time to take your businesses out of Chicago.. Because it‚Äôs those darn convenience stores that cause so much ‚Äúoppression‚Äù. Chicago mayor and DA should be held personally responsible.. They can thank Lightfoot who has allowed this to happen.. stop voting for Democrats, yes it's really that simple. A class action suit seems in order. There is strength in numbers. The only problem is collecting from a bankrupt city and state.. Exactly why we cannot have Democrats in office. Turn the whole country RED in 2020!!!!. He should just sit in the store with a gun and protect himself with the second amendment. Shoot one and the rest will run out. Hope he wins and then takes that money and moves his business somewhere where he can count on elected officials to actually defend his business and the law abiding citizens.. .... All the stores should sue the city and if they can't get money, get tax breaks or Zero property tax ...... Good Lord! What is happening to Democrats run cities? Portland, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Minneapolis. Why people why?. Should sue Chicago  , the BLM marxist and Antifa organizations  and the democratic party. ....all are guilty  !. I wish every business owner would move out and let these thugs kill each other and wipe Chicago off the map. I have zero sympathy. Mayor Beetlejuice maybe can justify?????. I think we need to send all the liberals to just one sanctuary town and let them just tear the hell out of it and let them live in those kind of conditions.. Chicago has had nothing but record high murders and garbage to report for the last ??? Years...why? Do good people even live there? If so why?. Arm yourself AND sue the governor, mayor and city. Crazy!!  WHO  raised  the  people  doing  this?  Never  in  my  wildest  worst  times  would  I ever  do  something like  this...NEVER!. Think hard before you vote!  You‚Äôre seeing just how important your choices are.. Avoid Chicago at all costs... I cannot fathom how anyone could possibly believe destroying the livelihoods of your fellow neighbors is productive in anyway.... How does destroying businesses that provide services to your area help in anyway? They are hurting their own communities by limiting supplies to everyone also. Imagine if that were your own business and people did that to you? Where are these peoples humanity?. Good for the shop owner, all businesses and private citizens  who have had their business and private properties vandalized and/or looted should be bringing class action suits against the mayors and governors who are allowing this to happen!  There are still laws against this ENFORCE THEM!. Macy's is moving out of downtown. Hopefully all the other businesses follow suit in Chicago. I couldn't imagine owning a business down there right now.. So Sad! Firearms are the answer as you drop each and every person coming in to loot your home or business!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏. I'd sue the city, the idiotic mayor and the worthless governor!!. I‚Äôm tired of the excuse the rioters give by saying ‚Äúthey have insurance they can rebuild‚Äù when they destroy a business. What about those who work there? Those who needs that job to pay their bills? You trash their business and burn it to the ground, those people are out of work. Hoping these businesses learn a lesson to not set up shop in these Democrat run cities that are letting everything burn. According to Nadler this is just the same clip being shown over and over again.  The rest of the democratics especially in DC say this is peaceful protest.  Democratics should be held accountable.  Those that allow this to happen for political gain.. These cities should be sued... you pay taxes for public safety and when they at best enable and encourage this chaos they should be held accountable. ‚ÄúThey have insurance.‚Äù  At least that‚Äôs what

and looters to stay sounds like they need to infuse the police with funds instead of defunding it is a shame time to take your businesses out of chicago because it is those darn convenience stores that cause so much oppression chicago mayor and da should be held personally responsible they can thank lightfoot who has allowed this to happen stop voting for democrats yes it is really that simple a class action suit seems in order there is strength in numbers the only problem is collecting from a bankrupt city and state exactly why we cannot have democrats in office turn the whole country red in 2020 he should just sit in the store with a gun and protect himself with the second amendment shoot one and the rest will run out hope he wins and then takes that money and moves his business somewhere where he can count on elected officials to actually defend his business and the law abiding citizens all the stores should sue the city and if they cannot get money get tax breaks or zero property tax good lord what is happening to democrats run cities portland new york seattle chicago minneapolis why people why should sue chicago the blm marxist and antifa organizations and the democratic party all are guilty i wish every business owner would move out and let these thugs kill each other and wipe chicago off the map i have zero sympathy mayor beetlejuice maybe can justify i think we need to send all the liberals to just one sanctuary town and let them just tear the hell out of it and let them live in those kind of conditions chicago has had nothing but record high murders and garbage to report for the last years why do good people even live there if so why arm yourself and sue the governor mayor and city crazy who raised the people doing this never in my wildest worst times would i ever do something like this never think hard before you vote you are seeing just how important your choices are avoid chicago at all costs i cannot fathom how anyone could possibly believe destroying the livelihoods of your fellow neighbors is productive in anyway how does destroying businesses that provide services to your area help in anyway they are hurting their own communities by limiting supplies to everyone also imagine if that were your own business and people did that to you where are these peoples humanity good for the shop owner all businesses and private citizens who have had their business and private properties vandalized and or looted should be bringing class action suits against the mayors and governors who are allowing this to happen there are still laws against this enforce them macys is moving out of downtown hopefully all the other businesses follow suit in chicago i could not imagine owning a business down there right now so sad firearms are the answer as you drop each and every person coming in to loot your home or business i would sue the city the idiotic mayor and the worthless governor i am tired of the excuse the rioters give by saying they have insurance they can rebuild when they destroy a business what about those who work there those who needs that job to pay their bills you trash their business and burn it to the ground those people are out of work hoping these businesses learn a lesson to not set up shop in these democrat run cities that are letting everything burn according to nadler this is just the same clip being shown over and over again the rest of the democratics especially in dc say this is peaceful protest democratics should be held accountable those that allow this to happen for political gain these cities should be sued you pay taxes for public safety and when they at best enable and encourage this chaos they should be held accountable they have insurance at least that is what that idiotic

Saw them on a Nat Geo trip - Amazing!!!. They certainly do look peaceful and wise. However, isn't this the species that has an elite class. Only the elites use the hot tub, and they force the others to sit outside in the cold weather, shivering with their babies.  This reality of nature does not bother me, but it runs counter to most of these comments.. Pat Bosler exactly üò¢. I always wonder how do they dry themselves. So Ling Yan not only do they bathe and meditate, they can also weave towels.. Niklos Moorman and invent blowdryer I hope. Its fur could dry out like a towel. So Ling Yan with towels. So Ling Yan saunas are the most popular way to go in Japan. So Ling Yan japanese hairdryers. I think I know how they feel. Ever take a bath in a leanto shed? Snow outside? Almost freezing inside and then the hot water (heated on a wood stove)?. I've experienced hot springs in Iceland in the middle of winter. Fantastic. I feel sorry for the lower caste monkeys of the troupe that are not allowed in the hot springs whilst the elite are in. Nature in action unfortunately.. Oh I too saw this snow monkeys at Hokkaido flower dome park.they extremely active.no sure whether is e same species.. They poop in the hot spring all the time. They keep a full time employee at the park just to clean up all the poop üí©üí©üí©üòÇ.. Even monkeys know to relax better than some humans... This is in Nagano, Japan!. What happens when they get out wet fur in the cold icicles?. Does anyone know how do snow monkeys to keep themselves dry and warm after they leave the hot spring?.

Bring back  school counselors. I was shocked when I was looking at middle schools for our daughter and found that there was an officer in uniform on campus at all times! For 5th thru 8th grade! Stop it! Our schools are so too heavy with administration, it's time to define what is necessary there!. i remember going to public school and they had to start bringing in police because of violent liberals. Church of Political Correctness You should be institutionalized.. Desiree Hrebtov one of these days we will find someone who will standup for our views.  Sure, they will probably get humiliated in a debate too,  BUT at least we will be standing up for ourselves!!! That will probably make the KKK mad!. Starting in the 1980's the US stopped hospitalizing the mentally ill and started incarcerating them, why is anyone surprised that they are doing it to physically disabled folks too?  Incarceration is the American answer to poverty, unemployment, and disability, it's what we do best, and with great enthusiasm.. Michael Garrison sadly, you are right.  Reagan closed the public hospitals and the mentally ill were on the streets.  Now many people want to get ‚Äúthose kids‚Äù away from their kids.  I work in special education.  I hear it and it makes me nauseous‚Äîfrom administrators to outspoken parents.. The most common consequence for children sent to jail is their failing that grade, because they have too large of a gap in their learning to catch up. Probably the 2nd most common consequence is their acquiring new friends (criminal friends.) The least likely consequence is rehabilitation. For some reason the government finds this unimportant.... Defund the racist public school system. Students with disabilities are the butt of all jokes. The other kids blame them for everything because they know the teacher will believe them and reprimand the student with a disability. I know this from experience.. This is why I Moved back to Canada. When we were in several school systems in the US, I could see them starting to treat my son like a criminal.  I wasn't having it, and now he's doing brilliantly. ...can not end that; it's a proven money-making niche.... As a teacher of emotionally Impaired students this is pretty much my kids exactly.  They are most likely to wind up in the system.  They get identified early, they generally have teachers who cannot or will not learn how to handle them and spend more t‚Ä¶See More. When I was in grade school in the '80's kids weren't arrested - disabled or not! I never heard about that. Have parents really become THIS inept as not be able to teach their own kids how be behave in school/society? Are you kidding me!!. A catholic school principal tried to set my son up.  Tried to accuse him of violence against an aide.  The aide told the truth; she had not followed his IEP, which directly led to a small, non-violent outburst.  This was part of a pattern of accusation‚Ä¶See More. So special needs kids who get put in normal schools aren‚Äôt having their special needs taken care of.

Through the rule, DeVos has drawn a clear line in the sand: choosing to support affluent private schools in violation of the law and at the expense of public schools. Our public schools serve th...e vast majority of students in this country, and they need additional resources and money to meet their needs, including: Black and Brown students, those with disabilities, English learners, and low-income children who are often excluded from private schools.

They do adhere to biblical teaching.  Children are taught reading , writing and arithmetic rather than sex orientation     I would rather my taxes go to those schools.   Considering what Teachers Union is doing right now,  we need change away from their liberal left ideology.. Private schools serve 33% students of colour.

WHO ARE LOs?  Legal Observers are lawyers, law students, and legal workers trained to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.  Legal observers monitor police behavior, not protesters.  Legal observers are identifiable by neon green hats that say ‚ÄúNational Lawyers Guild‚Äù and black vests with neon labels.  ON THE GROUND Legal observers watch and document police interactions with protesters to deter violent police tactics and for later legal advocacy in criminal and civil cases.  When protesters are arrested, we get necessary info to connect arrestees with legal and community support.  We make sure that the right to protest is protected and support protesters when they are targeted by the state.  LEGAL PROTECTIONS When a group request legal observers, we establish an attorney-client relationship with the organizers so that our work stays confidential.  This means notes, photos, and videos we take have an extra layer of protection and cannot be turned into evidence without organizer consent.  We seek to provide as much legal protection as possible for protesters and all legal observers are trained in preserving confidentiality.  WHAT WE DON‚ÄôT DO We cannot give legal advice on the ground, we cannot participate in protests or planning, and we must try to maintain some separation from protesters.  We do not monitor or judge protest tactics or tone. We do not pass judgment on ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù protesters, a distinction our chapter rejects.  We do not work with police or act as liaisons between police and protesters. We do not release info to media without explicit consent.  OTHER PROTEST SUPPORTÔøΩNLG‚Äôs Mass Defense Program includes legal observation on the ground, know your rights trainings, jail hotlines and jail support for those arrested during protest, and legal representation in protest cases.  Our hotline in Seattle is 206-OK-TRY-ME (206-658-7963).

Elizabeth Moorhead is that why many Culp ballots were so late getting counted or not at all. Just curious.  I know our mail from here in the Tri Cities, have gotten lost or not delivered.  True story.. Lou Smith sounds like that would be an issue with your county elections office since all ballots are counted locally in each county. If you have tracked your ballot online to see if it has been recieved then it will show when it is counted..

Elizabeth Moorhead and it took years to get it going so smoothly. Can‚Äôt be done in less than 3 months.. Elizabeth Moorhead.

Dont like Nancy... she needs to go... but I'm glad this is happening.. Josh Neff yeah she is too effective and men are threatened by her but sure.... Josh Neff  trump should go first before Nancy.. They all have to go. Political parties and lobbies have no legitimate place in sitting government, as they do nothing but corrupt. Either the parties can't stop it or won't stop it. Doesn't make any difference. As long as they're there, they are going to run the country, and they have no business doing that. It's in direct violation of the Constitution.. Jill Stohs My issue isn't her ability to be 'effective'... its how she's effective that I take issue with. She's very much in the back-pocket of corporate america. You can look through her voting record and find comparatively little which has benefit people vs businesses.. David Tran absolutely.. Josh Neff that goes for everyone of them since Reagan signed Citizens United. Before that there where specific laws about how much a special interest could give. Also Congress members where barred from owning stocks or any interest in a corporate entity. Any business interests had to be reported and given to US Treasury who would then issue them municipal bonds of value. Maybe she could work on renewing CaresAct funding too.. Tristan Smith ‚Äî no. There was money in the House bill for all states, because of lack of federal leadership all states were on their own to mitigate pandemic costs.. Morgan Alexander Did that 3 months ago.

It's been this way since before Trump and during the Obama administration. It takes 5 days for a letter to be mailed to an address across the street but you all want to blame Trump. How ignorant.. Monday the House prepared an emergency vote....next week!. The USPS is just fine. USPS doesn't need the 25 billion tax dollars.  Mail boxes and equipment are moved regularly.  The skanky hag Pelosi is tampering with the election. She's second in line for presidential succession. When the election ballots get jammed up for weeks in January that sleaze will grab the presidency.. Why do they need testimonies? All they can do is come up with a budget, send it to the Senate, send it to Trump and he will sign it!  The DemonicRATs can come up with trillions of dollars to give to China, Russia and Iran, go figure, but they need testimonials it it comes to what‚Äôs happening within our country!. Dolores B.

You can explain til you are blue in the face as I have, and people still can‚Äôt comprehend the difference.. Lynda Little ‚Äî there is no such thing as ‚Äúmass mailing‚Äù.

the conman told them that mail in ballots of which there were 25 million cast in 2016 are bad good luck to rural america on getting anything delivered without a functioning usps donn colby susan robinson fu k him and fu k you for spreading his thank you we have been all mail voting for more than 5 years in wa and think it is great elizabeth moorhead is that why many culp ballots were so late getting counted or not at all just curious i know our mail from here in the tri cities have gotten lost or not delivered true story lou smith sounds like that would be an issue with your county elections office since all ballots are counted locally in each county if you have tracked your ballot online to see if it has been recieved then it will show when it is counted elizabeth moorhead do not you remember all the eyman cucks calling the car tab election rigged since it was all mail in me either lol elizabeth moorhead and it took years to get it going so smoothly cannot be done in less than 3 months elizabeth moorhead it is so great in fact that we are still waiting for our primary votes to be counted how wonderful i cannot wait to find out in july of 2021 who won the presidential election really super awesome dont like nancy she needs to go but i am glad this is happening josh neff yeah she is too effective and men are threatened by her but sure josh neff trump should go first before nancy they all have to go political parties and lobbies have no legitimate place in sitting government as they do nothing but corrupt either the parties cannot stop it or will not stop it does not make any difference as long as they are there they are going to run the country and they have no business doing that it is in direct violation of the constitution jill stohs my issue is not her ability to be effective its how she is effective that i take issue with she is very much in the back pocket of corporate america you can look through her voting record and find comparatively little which has benefit people vs businesses david tran absolutely josh neff that goes for everyone of them since reagan signed citizens united before that there where specific laws about how much a special interest could give also congress members where barred from owning stocks or any interest in a corporate entity any business interests had to be reported and given to us treasury who would then issue them municipal bonds of value maybe she could work on renewing caresact funding too tristan smith no there was money in the house bill for all states because of lack of federal leadership all states were on their own to mitigate pandemic costs morgan alexander did that 3 months ago still on mcconnells desk morgan alexander agreed but trump needs to keep his nose out of usps trumps unraveling we are just starting to see the very beginning kathleen batinovich nemec dems wanted you bail out failed democrat ran states kathleen batinovich nemec true in the tri cities population of approximately 300 000 we have no post office other a place to buy stamps and check your po box it is been this way since before trump and during the obama administration it takes 5 days for a letter to be mailed to an address across the street but you all want to blame trump how ignorant monday the house prepared an emergency vote next week the usps is just fine usps does not need the 25 billion tax dollars mail boxes and equipment are moved regularly the skanky hag pelosi is tampering with the election she is second in line for presidential succession when the election ballots get jammed up for weeks in january that sleaze will grab the presidency why do they need testimonies all they can do is come up with a budget send it to the senate send it to trump and he will sign it the demonicrats can come up with trillions of dollars to give to china russia and iran go figure but they need testimonials it it comes to what is happening within our country dolores b pinaula knowledge is power do you ever question why this is so important to the democrats could it be so they can cheat i am willing to bet defund usps instead of the police demon crats fear disruption of their manipulation of elections scott mc scott mc name calling demonizing of the other without any evidence shoddy election time shenanigans from trump and supporters scott mc i do not mean to be rude but please put the crack pipe down and read very carefully the democratic party is not manipulating any elections look at mr trump scott mc republicans are going to lose they are out of touch in november they will be out of time scott mc scott mc agreed scott mc oh come on you know that is not true scott mc do you have any evidence for your claims the last only major voter fraud case was promulgated by the gop in north carolina evidence of voter fraud is basically nonexistent but why let facts get in your way scott mc drink up scott mc scott mc meanwhile in reality president trump has already all but admitted he is going to manipulate the election scott mc i want my medications on time it has little to do with politics in the long run scott mc troll scott mc enjoy your clorox cocktail scott mc no crackpots please the stupidity and trolling in the comments never fails to disappoint chris smith yes chris they never fail do they nancy is evil and is not to be trusted she lied after over 45 years suddenly they care tim cook exactly spot on right just like the last one how did 45 win lol demoncrats whenever i see this i automatically assume whoever wrote it is also a flat earther and involved in qanon joy weiss trolls from a troll factory prob in russia or africa but she will not come back to negotiate covid relief seems like she hates the american people matt rutledge put down the pipe its the gop senate that never made a deal sadly moscow mitch wont do the same for the senate they want to talk about mail in ballots instead of helping the people _ robert reyes the house has already passed the covid bill moscow mitch has refused to let it be voted on and the senate hasnt sent a bill of their own to the house yet its completely in the senates court right now robert reyes being able to vote by mail is helping people unless you somehow think access to voting is not a right mail helps people its because they know the cowardly republicans will not do anything to help they have made that blatantly clear robert reyes it is helping the people anything to get trump and his cronies out of office julie crudele while you are there how about working on the stimulus package not true voting by mail is one of the safest ways to vote especially during a global pandemic show me a reliable study that says otherwise you can use google to find several academic articles that say it is safe and does not favor either party in pam braun actually i do read them but apparently you do not or if you do you do not comprehend them know what i am done talking with you you obviously suffer from extreme tds and it affects your ability to see things logically continue to live in your own little bubble it just may burst bye deb west nope it is a distinction without a real difference voter fraud is not a real problem people well there were the republican in nc caught collecting and filling out ballots you know most cases the few prosecuted are by republicans huh tell that to the people of new york who had their ballots tossed out new jersey shall i continue mail is safe google mail theft lynda little i think schooling would be wasted on you but that is ok trump loves the uneducated deb west sometimes i just have to shake my head and walk away you cannot fix stupid and it just causes my blood pressure to rise trying to do it pam braun well i had to for primary in 2016 it was on the outside of the envelope you had to identify your party dusty belair i voted this year during the primary and there were no identifiable markings on the outside of the envelope denoting party affiliation there was also a slip on the inside for privacy so you cannot see through the envelope pam braun you are making a fool of yourself tom stewart true they are out on a hard earned va cay nancy why is it so difficult for people to understand the difference between absentee ballot and mass mailing you can explain til you are blue in the face as i have and people still cannot comprehend the difference lynda little there is no such thing as mass mailing ballots are sent to registered voters not dropped out of a plane for anyone to pick up lynda little both are processed exactly the same how can it be so difficult to understand this is not the publishers clearing house sweepstakes ballots are sent to registered voters not blindly to addresses how about the people greedy old woman so fake problem is all 3 have to agree coming back now for this bs is just a waste of taxpayer funds they scrambled did they lol this is their vacation time yes a week to gather the house is a scramble since the mail ins envelopes will be designated with a d or an r depending on your affiliation it should be rather easy to toss the ds in the shredder alfred colley source please i have lived in a vote by mail state for over 20 years your statement is too stupid to bother to refute troll block do not you have an applebees to check in at alfred colley all envelopes look the same did you graduate from trump university really i am serious if so you need to ask for a refund and you might ask for a new k 12 education while you are at it they all look the same crickets alfred colley primary ballots in the primary elections people have to vote for the party they are registered with that is not the case in the general election post office what about the stimulus package where was crying nancy for the last 20 yrs while the postal service lost billions of dollars and tries to cover her failures during special budgets why was this done during normal budget time it is a scam pam morrell um you are the one telling veterans at usps that they do not matter and as a liberal what do you think my position on pentagon spending has been for the last 40 years pam morrell they do need money because congress passed a law requiring them to pre fund pensions for decades into the future you need to read that article tom bourg hahahaha pam morrell they made a profit in 2014 julie crudele pam morrell nothing was done during normal budget time because trump waited till it was over to start pulling the mailboxes and shutting down the post office if this was really necessary why was not it done two years ago the reason why it is pam morrell have you left your home to go to the dr the grocery store gas station walmart cvs was that a yes you can vote in person what delivery interruptions are those right after her third bottle why there is no crisis at the post office according to the head of the american federation of government employees afge this is just another democratic faux crisis perpetuated by their media lackeys philip and he calls for the heroes act to be passed to prevent problems in his summation and calls out trumps intent to sabotage he is stating explicitly that what pelosi is doing is necessary and proper derek pounds yes did you the national association of letter carriers nalc and the american postal workers union apwu know the truth the

If the answer is no, you're not alone. Maybe it's time to shrink the number of statewide elected officials and put the responsibility of some offices under the control of the governor. Ultimately, this would increase public accountability, writes Jason Mercier of the Washington Policy Center in an Op-Ed.","These positions should remain elected positions so those elected are accountable to the public.  Making them appointed positions would increase the likelihood elected officials would appoint their cronies.  We have enough of that in DC now.. I think more people this year can name the State Superintendent and none of us want Inslee appointing someone to that position.  Maia Espinoza for State Superintendent 2020.  I think giving the governor any more control would be more of a disaster.  No thank you.  People should be informed and should vote.. Tami Stander Kee and they don't. Most of us rely on other groups to inform voting. It's not really an individual thing. I mean. I can find out any of these people in like 5 seconds.The question is if it's useful for us to vote on this. Or if they should just be appointed positions. The Washington Policy Center is a right-wing pro-corporate think tank that's butthurt about, for example, an elected Insurance Commissioner that keeps Washingtonian's best interest at heart.. I think many of us have very different political views but what we all seem to agree on is that this is a terrible idea..

The worst thing is when you end up with some supervisor who‚Äôs a bad person and doesn‚Äôt care about people.. Milan Toma For me, it's about advising style and expectations...when to put a lot of pressure on the advisee, for instance, and when to be more friendly and encouraging. The 'iron sharpens iron' approach doesn't work well with me personally. Lol, so basically an incoming grad student needs to have such a sharp innate sense of human psychology so they can ‚Äúsmell‚Äù the advisors with good vs bad personalities during the short amount of time at visit days. That, or be able to discern which of the upperclassmen stories are most plausible.. Cara G. Chapel I see, that totally makes sense. In my case, I didn't have direct help like that from any professors during my undergrad, it was more about looking up professors online, chatting with grad students from different programs etc. Either way‚Ä¶See More.

I was truly concerned that if I switched advisors, there would be repercussions of some sort, but it turned out that after I passed comps, my advisor himself told me something along the lines of.

Shaun Russell if only that was true for my program. Seems to depend on the reputation/prestige of the mentor your leaving whether it is possible. Instead I had no choice but to leave my program entirely once working with my mentor was no longer an option for me.. Haha, yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a survival of the fittest, but so are most things in life. Lol, I didn‚Äôt take myself too seriously when I commented, and I was not expecting so many responses. Very interesting perspectives!. Also, you can always do your research. Specially contacting former students can be very helpful.. Irina Cristali Seconding what Shaun said.

It led me down the p‚Ä¶See More. You can tell a great deal by taking a course with them. (I couldn't but then, that's me.). Irina Cristali already gave you suggestions about what to look for.

Interview potential PIs as intensely as they're interviewing potential grad students. You're 'auditioning' them as much as they're evaluating you. Don't just hope to get accepted to any program. Because when things go badly it's awful for everyone involved. It's extremely important to select a program based on an advisor that will work well with you..

Irina Cristali more like ask the right questions and don't be afraid to ask around. Irina Cristali 'Survival of the fittest' I wish it was as simplistic as that. Spend a few years at UChicago and you will realize.. Irina Cristali I think it is more about identifying your most productive work conditions and how you work best with a manager/advisor and then having an honest conversation with potential advisors before you make a decision.. I chose my MS advisor poorly and it was the worst decision of my life. My MS was an absolute nightmare. I had to fire my entire committee and form a new one to graduate. Fortunately my advisor for my PhD was awesome. Otherwise there's no way I'd have been able to stick through it to the end.. Well said. I chose poorly for my PhD, finding someone who matched my research interest and purportedly had expertise to offer, but had no vested interest in mentoring.

As a grad student, I have very commonly worked in the lab 9am-7pm, weekends included. And considering that day has 24 hours, plus one has to sleep, I dont see the math here. I guess it depends on the field, but in chemistry, grad school is a full time (and more) job. If you cannot invest your time into it, it is quite impossible to succeed.. Most of my friends in anthropology had jobs, because they didn't have departmental support. They also tended to take on average 8-10 years to complete a PhD.. Romi It really is based on discipline--some of us can/need to balance FT jobs and studies. If anything, that's even more important when choosing a mentor because I would hate to have one who felt I wasn't dedicated enough bc I need to work. My FT emplo‚Ä¶See More. My full time job was at the university conducting research, and I developed additional funding to address my PhD interests. And, I was pretty adamant about living a balanced life without being taken advantage of by unreasonable demands. That didn‚Äôt sit‚Ä¶See More. Romi Jaro≈°ov√° the ‚Äúhow‚Äù may vary by discipline. My dad did his PhD while working FT in administration at a 2 yr technical college and 5 of us 7 children still lived at home (youngest was already 9 or so though, no infants). His university was also a 45 minute drive away. His discipline was English though, so lab work wasn‚Äôt part of it.  I‚Äôm not sure he slept and he did take 7.5 yrs to finish but he made it work.. It very much seems that a handful of mentors swap mentees into faculty openings and that it does not matter at all how brilliant or ground breaking the research is of the poor saps who didn‚Äôt work with these gate keepers.. Wes Grooms spot on. Wes Grooms yup. I know what you are talking about. If one individual relationship can make or break a career, perhaps it is time to put all our brilliant, critical minds to work on alternatives to the current structures.. Yes,  one  person  shouldn‚Äôt  have  that  much  power  over  someone  else‚Äôs career.  It‚Äôs all  well  and  good to  tell  new  researchers  to  choose  their  mentors wisely,  but  how  are  they  to  know  which  ones  turn  out  to  be  psychopaths?. I made some bad choices from the get-go. Some were my fault; others were not. I ended up having to ask my MA thesis advisor (from a different university) to co-chair my dissertation committee. If it were not for him, I would have quit. Drove 350 miles to nurse me through comps, which were very much like swimming though a pool of broken glass. I picked my mentors because I admired their work. Luckily for me, they are also two wonderful human beings. I wouldn't have made it through my program without their support.. It sometimes can be really tough to tell, especially when the advisors are very manipulative and are able to convince their current students that the toxic environment they created is normal. If you end up with an advisor that doesn‚Äôt workout, your car‚Ä¶See More. Absolutely the truth. My mentor coached me through my MA, then hired me as full-time faculty only a year after I finished my PhD. She is the reason I went into academia and I can never thank her enough.. My dissertation committee has been out to lunch the entire time‚Äîexcept for the head. He gets done what needs done‚Äîbut offers no encouragement. He just clicks the boxes. I‚Äôm months away from finishing and I will absolutely never teach at a public university. It‚Äôs turned me away.. I've chosen my university through my supervisors. While for me it was the logical thing to do and I was lucky those folks wanted to work with me, you never know whether relationships may change down the road. They can get better but they can also get worse.. My mentor is now in his 80s. I spend a week with him and his wife every summer. He has dementia, it is rapidly progressing, and I have a textbook that was just published that I dedicated to him. I am trying so hard to get him a copy while he can still recognize how I'm honoring him ‚òπÔ∏è. It's breaking my heart, he is SO important to me, still. ‚ù§Ô∏è A good mentor changes your life.. They can also make or break your mental health. You're extremely reliant on this person and spending a good deal of time with them. You want to make sure you're a good match research-wise, but also personality. Having an advisor that I communicated well with and was supportive was the only reason I finished my PhD.. Alexis Layman Mraz This is so true! The amount of pressure is already too high and when the matches are not good, it can lead to burnout.. So much this! I left grad school (ABD) in part due to poor mentorship. I went on to a career evaluating graduate and postdoc programs, and strong mentorship was always one of the most important factors in making a program and it's participants successful. Not enough is said about this to starry-eyed undergrads looking for the right name..  I had some trouble with this during my Master‚Äôs. I learned that valuable lesson before the PhD. I am incredibly fortunate to have had an amazing PhD chair and two amazing committee members.. Yep, I chose mine based off of research AND personality (totally ignored university prestige and location). Best decision I ever made - she was and still is unwaveringly supportive, not only of my research but of my physical and mental health.The way‚Ä¶See More. How many students can become suicidal and make attempts because of a supervisor....? So far our count is 4 and it‚Äôs continuing after changing supervisor. Absolutely choose your supervisor carefully.. In practicality, it‚Äôs better to have a poorer mentor and more well-received institution. From what I‚Äôve seen, this holds true in academia and industry contexts alike.. Definitely. Advice for prospective grad students: don't just interview your potential supervisor before making a decision: if possible, reach out to their former students as well.. I have a friend who's been through hell, is on the verge of quitting altogether, after many years, because of her mentor. I also think that it's almost impossible to tell. I think university needs to be rethought and recycled.. I had no idea who I wanted to mentor me during my doctorate. Got very lucky and met my supervisor at a lecture in the first week. I had no idea if he was even interested in my research topic but I knew I had to ask... five years later I wrote something I am so proud of that I actually hope it gets published eventually. The right mentors make or break.. When you come from a poor background, you get chosen by the scholarship team. You have zero say in either the university or the mentor.. The words are the truth - if you fail to pick mentor that is good for you - this doctoral experience can and will be a nightmare for  you.  Look at your mentor's vitae - see if they work with students and if they do - who is the lead author on student'‚Ä¶See More. Kris Machtmes exactly.. This is one of the most important post for aspiring PhD candidates. I chose my advisor and uni because I was told she was the best in my field and the university had prestige. Turns out she didn't chose me for my project or my intellect. Rather the fee‚Ä¶See More. Also, there was only one person at the university I could have changed  to as advisor. Guess who he was married to.... Also, don‚Äôt forget that students pick advisors. Mentors pick themselves, with a little encouragement from the student.. So true - It broke me for many, many years . Still no closure or accountability for egos or downright lies to cover backs.. I chose mine based off research interests and my experience with them through undergrad. WOW was that a stunningly bad move. How staff treat non-threatening undergrads and how they treat postgrad students who can question them can be very different.. The whole advisory team is important in terms of having a mix of expertise that the student can tap into, and varying approaches to supervision/training/support. I was very lucky during my honours and PhD, and got different things from my different supervisors. It's something I try to replicate now when putting together supervisory teams for my students.. One tool for figuring this out is to use social media and their website to see what credit they give to their research students. Are the authors diverse? Do the students get lead credit? Are the students presenting their research or is the faculty doing it all? Social media has really changed the game.. Absolutely agree with this - all the prestige in the world won't mean squat if you don't finish and get a good piece of work out of it, and that won't happen if you and your supervisor don't gel. I turned down a place to study my PhD at Cambridge to wo‚Ä¶See More. And do lab  rotations if you can!. Don't confuse a supervisor with a mentor in the first place. They're different things.. My grad advisor used me to do his work and hindered my work. He was absolutely lacking in every way.. This was the best and biggest tip my Honors Thesis supervisor gave me in undergrad and I will always and forever be thankful to him for it!. Congratulations for finding a fit mentor; I couldn't find any, fit or otherwise.I'll be thankful if I get a relevant postdoc mentor right now.. I changed my university from Cornell to Univ. of New Mexico to work with the right advisor. I never regretted that decision until he passed away 2 months before my defence.. Tijen Tunali Oh wow! That sounds horrible! Amazing that you still graduated though! And cool that you are in Europe too! I‚Äôd actually be interested to talk to you about our experiences and now being in Europe and all that - would you mind if I sent you a message?. Jana Wilbricht The story gets more tragic while waiting for an advisor to replace my prof.and she was the biggest manipulator I have met in my life. It took me 3 years to graduate with a finished dissertation. I am back to Europe too :). I chose a great school with vastly less prestige than a top 3 choice I had in my field precisely because I had great options for a mentor!. How do you see if your potential advisor is a good fit or not if you have never met/worked with them?. ‰ºçÊò≠Êòé exactly what I have heard from my colleagues. I agree that talking to the students is important for some kind of second/third opinions. But perhaps some students are not comfortable to speak frankly about their PI especially if the students will still be working for them for a long time.. You should meet with them at least once.  I mean you're going to be working closely with them for years.  Talking with their current and former students is also a good way to determine their mentor style.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to their current students without the PI present. Ask them straight what it's like to work with the PI and what their expectations are.. Fadil Habibi Danufane you will be able to tell whether they actively like the professor or just reluctant to criticize him/her due to other concerns. Fadil Habibi Danufane I met with several prospective advisors remotely, never in person.. ‰ºçÊò≠Êòé definitely. I think you can't be shy to work with another mentor if it becomes evident that the fit isn't right.  A bad fit might not be evident at first.. I asked a lot of questions, including their mentoring philosophy, expectations, how they approach various scenarios, how they like to give feedback, how often they like to meet, how writing papers with them works, how decisions are made, stuff like that. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to them ahead of time, talk to their students, read between the lines in what the students say. Look at their past students‚Äîwhere are they now? If it‚Äôs a newer PI, reach out to past undergrad mentees. A new pi should be willing to give references to them.. You can read about them and see if they are a bad fit for everyone or not.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to former and current students. it's so hard to know what to even ask if you've never experienced it.... but one good one is 'how is work life balance ?'. Talking to current/former students is tricky. 10 people, 10opinions. I loved my advisor when I was ar grad school, while there where people who really didnt like him and decided to leave.. Fadil Habibi Danufane Rolling the dice on whether or not a positive interaction is indicative of a positive future relationship with someone directly in your field of interest is definitely superior to just YOLOing a school for name recognition and hoping for the best. That was a long sentence.At least try to Zoom or phone interview with people beforehand. It is worth it.. Big red flag: they don't graduate many students in a reasonable amount of time. This is easy to find out.. In academia (at least in the US), the status of the university defines everything. The rest is b.....t. I'd love to be able to find the funding to go with my supervisor of choice but sadly that not currently happening üò≠üò≠üò§. The same applies when picking graduate students.. Choose carefully for  the short term and the long term  both.. Hard to do when one is assigned!. I learnt that the hard way.. Pat Owen does this count as a citation?. Definitely read it at first to be referring to our study! Might have to count it just to be on the safe side ;). Travel time and tell me this...  maybe I‚Äôd still be doing science and not drywall. And that isn‚Äôt a joke...  if you find yourself in a masters degree with an advisor who hates you...  GTFO, industry if you can..  unless you want to do a ‚Äúunderpaid‚Äù internship...  and if you think science is awesome and that could never happen...  got some news for you. Zarmeen Khan  yup yup yup.. Abso-frickin-lutely.  I chose two of my my three thesis advisors based on personality rather than politics, and when I defended, the woman I chose to lead the committee intervened at personal cost and saved my graduation date from the vindictive harrid‚Ä¶See More. Cara G. Chapel Yes. I had a great Ph.D. Advisor but I had asked a professor that I thought would be supportive to be on the committee. After he said yes, I heard from other students and faculty about how he did what you described. Fortunately, for me, he took a job elsewhere about 6 months before I defended. I have never been so glad to see a moving truck leave.. I'm not in academia but health care and you speak the truth. When I was attempting to get admission to a PhD program, I was given absolutely horrible advice from my half brother, an asshole, which helped sink me. I did not know better. Few people really know going in what they need to know and do. Mentors are *so* important.

best for me my current advisor ticks a lot of the same boxes but his temperament is far more complementary to mine and it has made a huge difference shaun russell former advisor was not a fit for you or you were not a fit for him shaun russell i am just trying to understand how can someone not be a good fit for a good person the worst thing is when you end up with some supervisor who is a bad person and does not care about people milan toma for me it is about advising style and expectations when to put a lot of pressure on the advisee for instance and when to be more friendly and encouraging the iron sharpens iron approach does not work well with me personally lol so basically an incoming grad student needs to have such a sharp innate sense of human psychology so they can smell the advisors with good vs bad personalities during the short amount of time at visit days that or be able to discern which of the upperclassmen stories are most plausible cara g chapel i see that totally makes sense in my case i did not have direct help like that from any professors during my undergrad it was more about looking up professors online chatting with grad students from different programs etc either lindsay rachel ^ yup exactly this i was truly concerned that if i switched advisors there would be repercussions of some sort but it turned out that after i passed comps my advisor himself told me something along the lines of jenna lynn cody this is why liberal arts colleges are better i maintain contact and advising with my students for years after they graduate baft irina shaun russell if only that was true for my program seems to depend on the reputation prestige of the mentor your leaving whether it is possible instead i had no choice but to leave my program entirely once working with my mentor was no longer an option for me haha yeah it is definitely a survival of the fittest but so are most things in life lol i did not take myself too seriously when i commented and i was not expecting so many responses very interesting perspectives also you can always do your research specially contacting former students can be very helpful irina cristali seconding what shaun said i came in and selected my advisor based on like research interests he is an amazing scholar and was a fantastic advisor but he was not into the signature research methodology of my program it led me down the you can tell a great deal by taking a course with them i could not but then that is me irina cristali already gave you suggestions about what to look for i rocked some boats changing mine but i am in korea and they have an intense mega hierarchy filled culture still did it though and i am still alive interview potential pis as intensely as they are interviewing potential grad students you are auditioning them as much as they are evaluating you do not just hope to get accepted to any program because when things go badly it is awful for everyone involved it is extremely important to select a program based on an advisor that will work well with you mike fabris i assumed you meant that the undergraduate mentor would know and could advise on the postgrad faculty because they were colleagues at the same institution my bad my undergraduate professors knew little about my postgrad faculty other mona luiza moscutza ungureanu yikes shay welch sure but that is does not solve the problem for everyone also even if i would kept in touch w my profs from undergrad my work experience put me in a totally different field through an ma program in a different country so there is not much irina cristali yeah cannot we all just consult our crystal balls as a tenure track librarian so that a nonacademic to all other tenure track folks apparently mentors i have met have taken joy in careers they have never helped foster or even taken irina cristali more like ask the right questions and do not be afraid to ask around irina cristali survival of the fittest i wish it was as simplistic as that spend a few years at uchicago and you will realize irina cristali i think it is more about identifying your most productive work conditions and how you work best with a manager advisor and then having an honest conversation with potential advisors before you make a decision i chose my ms advisor poorly and it was the worst decision of my life my ms was an absolute nightmare i had to fire my entire committee and form a new one to graduate fortunately my advisor for my phd was awesome otherwise there is no way i would have been able to stick through it to the end well said i chose poorly for my phd finding someone who matched my research interest and purportedly had expertise to offer but had no vested interest in mentoring seeing as i developed my own funding was

their expectations are fadil habibi danufane you will be able to tell whether they actively like the professor or just reluctant to criticize him her due to other concerns fadil habibi danufane i met with several prospective advisors remotely never in person definitely i think you cannot be shy to work with another mentor if it becomes evident that the fit is not right a bad fit might not be evident at first i asked a lot of questions including their mentoring philosophy expectations how they approach various scenarios how they like to give feedback how often they like to meet how writing papers with them works how decisions are made stuff like that fadil habibi danufane talk to them ahead of time talk to their students read between the lines in what the students say look at their past students where are they now if it is a newer pi reach out to past undergrad mentees a new pi should be willing to give references to them you can read about them and see if they are a bad fit for everyone or not fadil habibi danufane talk to former and current students it is so hard to know what to even ask if you have never experienced it but one good one is how is work life balance talking to current former students is tricky 10 people 10opinions i loved my advisor when i was ar grad school while there where people who really didnt like him and decided to leave fadil habibi danufane rolling the dice on whether or not a positive interaction is indicative of a positive future relationship with someone directly in your field of interest is definitely superior to just yoloing a school for name recognition and hoping for the best that was a long sentence at least try to zoom or phone interview with people beforehand it is worth it big red flag they do not graduate many students in a reasonable amount of time this is easy to find out in academia at least in the us the status of the university defines everything the rest is b t i would love to be able to find the funding to go with my supervisor of choice but sadly that not currently happening the same applies when picking graduate students choose carefully for the short term and the long term both hard to do when one is assigned i learnt that the hard way pat owen does this count as a citation definitely read it at first to be referring to our study might have to count it just to be on the safe side travel time and tell me this maybe i would still be doing science and not drywall and that is not a joke if you find yourself in a masters degree with an advisor who hates you gtfo industry if you can unless you want to do a underpaid internship and if you think science is awesome and that could never happen got some news for you zarmeen khan yup yup yup abso frickin lutely i chose two of my my three thesis advisors based on personality rather than politics and when i defended the woman i chose to lead the committee intervened at personal cost and saved my graduation date from the vindictive cara g chapel yes i had a great ph d advisor but i had asked a professor that i thought would be supportive to be on the committee after he said yes i heard from other students and faculty about how he did what you described fortunately for me he took a job elsewhere about 6 months before i defended i have never been so glad to see a moving truck leave i am not in academia but health care and you speak the truth when i was attempting to get admission to a phd program i was given absolutely horrible advice from my half brother an asshole which helped sink me i did not know better few people really know going in what they need to know and do mentors are so important lifting each other up is crucial ,"['students', 'phd', 'work', 'good', 'advisor', 'time', 'research', 'mentor', 'grad',

Zoom look more professorial,"I`m giving a conference-presentation on Zoom next week and I was thinking that it`s going to look weird with my tidy room. It`s great that someone has taken the time on their busy schedule to make such a thorough instructional video I can utilize to overcome this problem.. Use cats. As long as you have a couple of cute furballs in the back, you could have a skinned, decapitated corpse right next to you and no one would complain. Trust me, I've tried it before. Works like a charm.. I have three cats, I know what you mean üòª. I'm desperately trying to hide that I'm set up in the corner of a room that was never really unpacked. I signed for the house the same week I did my first capstone defense, and setting up the spare bedroom was never a priority. Yesterday, work gave m‚Ä¶See More. It‚Äôs missing some random tangled electronic cords that serve no function because the thing no longer works, also: where are the random carrier bags stashed in the corner?? Otherwise nailed it!!. After my defence, when my committee handed me their copies back so I could make my ‚Äúminor changes‚Äù, I literally found someone‚Äôs name and phone number written on top of a page on one person‚Äôs copy. I could not for the life of me figure out if I was supposed to call that person or not.. I think you should call Human Resources... after you're done, of course, just to play it safe.... Andr√© Guerreiro lol, just to clarify, this was more than a decade ago.. This is amazing. Please call the number.. I'm under the impression that many commentors here have not watched the actual video (it's humour wink wink). Tom As Veines yeah that‚Äôs pretty clear.. That's a relief. I'm gonna need to see a couple of dead, dusty plants in the corner.  Otherwise the he look isn't fully professional. üòÑ. Christina Rivers Now we're talking, thanks!. I was completely called out by this video.. Krista Smith my thoughts exactly. I‚Äôm clearing out the dead plants Monday. Effortless but not quite sprezzatura. Sprezzatura is an Italian word that first appears in Baldassare Castiglione's 1528 The Book of the Courtier, where it is defined by the author as 'a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever'. Kimberley Sarah I suspect you're too well organized to feel seen by this video or to feel the need to raid other languages for words to justify a certain nonchalance and lack of planning.. Haha so much effort into appearing nonchalant üòÖ. No printer paper - printer broke months ago :( There are bookshelves in mine, but not neat at all...

time on their busy schedule to make such a thorough instructional video i can utilize to overcome this problem use cats as long as you have a couple of cute furballs in the back you could have a skinned decapitated corpse right next to you and no one would complain trust me i have tried it before works like a charm i have three cats i know what you mean i am desperately trying to hide that i am set up in the corner of a room that was never really unpacked i signed for the house the same week i did my first capstone defense and setting up the spare bedroom was never a priority yesterday work gave it is missing some random tangled electronic cords that serve no function because the thing no longer works also where are the random carrier bags stashed in the corner otherwise nailed it after my defence when my committee handed me their copies back so i could make my minor changes i literally found someones name and phone number written on top of a page on one persons copy i could not for the life of me figure out if i was supposed to call that person or not i think you should call human resources after you are done of course just to play it safe andr guerreiro lol just to clarify this was more than a decade ago this is amazing please call the number i am under the impression that many commentors here have not watched the actual video it is humour wink wink tom as veines yeah that is pretty clear that is a relief i am gonna need to see a couple of dead dusty plants in the corner otherwise the he look is not fully professional christina rivers now we are talking thanks i was completely called out by this video krista smith my thoughts exactly i am clearing out the dead plants monday effortless but not quite sprezzatura sprezzatura is an italian word that first appears in baldassare castigliones 1528 the book of the courtier where it is defined by the author as a certain nonchalance so as to conceal all art and make whatever kimberley sarah i suspect you are too well organized to feel seen by this video or to feel the need to raid other languages for words to justify a certain nonchalance and lack of planning haha so much effort into appearing nonchalant no printer paper printer broke months ago there are bookshelves in mine but not neat at all and i do mid class break out and say oh i have a book on that and spend 5 minutes shuffling

tenured, or attractive","I remember my first student evaluations: 1) more short skirts 2) your hair looks so much better down 3) the psych building is too far away from my dorm room. I decided at this point that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my teaching. ‚Ä¶See More. Kristy M Keefe My first semester teaching I got two comments saying to ‚Äúwear less clothes‚Äù üò≥ As a new instructor this was not what I was expecting and not helpful in how I could improve as an educator. Sadly, this may have been the first time I received comments about my appearance but it was not the last.. Ugh! That's sexual harassment. I got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt, literally. Kristy M Keefe I had the opposite for the hair. My hair is long and I always wear it down. Student said that I either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is unprofessional.. Students will reach for anything when they want to be negative. One time a student asked me a question about the midterm, and I said I hadn't finished it yet. They mentioned that in my RMP rating, lol. Like they never procrastinate?. Amanda Carroll were you tempted to clap back with ‚Äòdo you mean fewer?‚Äô These sites are just nonsense.  Appalling levels of sexual harassment, and not just against women; I‚Äôve known male teachers have similarly inappropriate comments posted.. Kristy M Keefe For sure! üòä. Amanda Greubel nope. I have also had some wonderfully thoughtful comments about my courses. I‚Äôll take the bad with the good.. Angry people en route.... Joshua Shinn How dare you!I'm not angry, I just hate to disappoint anyone.. Being a good prof doesn't hurt either. Michael W. Hitch I had this one professor back in my college days that was, without a doubt, the best professor I ever had. His RMP ratings were trashed because he wasn't an easy A. A lot of us couldn't believe it because we loved him and he asked if w‚Ä¶See More. Michael W. Hitch dude, it doesn‚Äôt matter for some of us. Christ.. Being a good professor has nothing to do with good evaluations, and I would go so far to say that the effective professor does not get good reviews. Do be glib though.. üôÑ. Woosh. My teaching reviews, like my article reviews, fell neatly into thirds: one third - fantastic, no improvement needed; one third - ok but...; one third - who let this idiot leave his village? I suffered a bit because my undergrad subject was a demanding ‚Ä¶See More. The person paying for the service should be the one to decide how that service should be evaluated.If they want to judge it on financial merit or educational merit or social merit it‚Äôs up to them. ‚Ä¶See More. Stephen Cooper Setting aside the sneer in your comment, my point was of course that the principle of having one‚Äôs teaching evaluated is fine, but the execution ends up failing it‚Äôs purpose. I doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the stud‚Ä¶See More. My favorite criticism from a student on RMP: ‚Äúevery other professor wants you to succeed. She only cares about how much you learn.‚Äù The rest of the review made clear that ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù was just about a specific letter grade.Student evals usually tell us more about students than about teachers.. My favorite criticism on a student eval: ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt teach us the content, she expects us to learn it ourselves.‚Äù Apparently the fact that I don‚Äôt lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood teaching.‚Äù ü§¶üèª_‚ôÄÔ∏è. No kiddin'?You mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest.  I'll be damned.. You're not wrong.. Tenure > attractive, any day. Promote these large nostrils and heavy baggaged eyes please.. I won‚Äôt lie‚Äî the chili peppers are from my nephews. Should I remind that correlation does not mean causation?. Innokenty Kantor you seem to assume that universities hire more poorly qualified non-white non-males over better qualified white males, whereas in reality, the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against people who are more‚Ä¶See More. Innokenty Kantor thanks for explaining my comment for me. Yes because being male or white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges. The way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face bias.. Jacq Jones Not at all. I think it is the opposite: those who think that ANY disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination, are just burying their heads in sand. Because they don't like the implications.. Ransell D'Souza He was trying to write 'of course' in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as 'of cause.' Notice he also replaced the word hire with 'high.' It's probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof. Innokenty Kantor unless you are already hiring inferior candidates who happen to fit your bias - eg white men. In which case expanded the range of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires.. What's of cause?. Innokenty Kantor yes, it‚Äôs nice (apologies for not getting reference). I‚Äôd love to see this extended to include racial bias because, sadly, I think this would be even more pronounced. And the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at best.. Innokenty Kantor there seems to be a strong correlation that white men don‚Äôt believe academia is sexist and racist (backed up by several studies). Seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them,. the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their 'existing culture' (which is really just code for biases towards wht they THINK ideal candidates are like, and the d‚Ä¶See More. Issues with the methodology but not news.. I don‚Äôt even look anymore. You must not be an adjunct. I don‚Äôt want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs I apply to every year. Well, I get three out of four.. That‚Äôs how I do it. üòä. Wait there are adults who actually care about what's written on ratemyprofessor?. No of you should ever, under any circumstances, read Rate My Professor. No good comes of it.  And I FIRMLY believe there should be a ‚ÄúRate My Student‚Äù site. üòë. Mirrors typical life. I don't bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage.. Ditto. Especially after reading a rape fantasy.. I hope you reported that.. Bob Borrelli why? So they can all laugh about it? Pick up lines, graphic sexual fantasies, sexual assault and notes like ‚Äúpretty sure I found your house‚Äù were totally ignored.. Ta-Shana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you.. You brought it to our attention years ago. White? Yes. Male? No. Tenured? Hahaha. Attractive? Um.... Brenna E. Culbert. My favorite comment on RMP was ‚Äúshe has a lot of patience, even with the stupid question people.‚Äù. Amanda Evert they repeated your study.. Sarina Kilham. Thanks. Adding it to my stockpile of evidence.. Hadil Ghoneim here you go.. I'm attractive though üòÑüòÑ. White? Yes. Male? Yes? Tenured? No. Attractive? Not really. My RMP ratings still suck, although I have a few good ones.. Jess Moore, the most frequent descriptor people use for me is 'boring'. That one cuts me to my soul. I'm fun!. Brian Paul I agree and my ratings are largely good, and even the 'negative ones' are worthwhile üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Brian Paul I just got a bad review for giving too much work for a minimester class. I'm not even sure how to take that. Am I supposed to assign less work during a minimester? I was told you're supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now I wonder about that.. Aurora Le well shit. Ami Sedani new study! More like duh lol.  Lisa Parker Lebovitz. Daniel Malcom thanks! I‚Äôve got to get back to the data, I think we can refute this. Maybe the young white male faculty aren‚Äôt as attractive to students in pharmacy as in humanities...üòù. Francesca Bosisio!!!. My favourite bit of feedback received from a student, who scored my course a 0:'Please can there be better references, not of those written ages ago when they used sophisticated words'Cause who comes to university to learn sophisticated words? Lets u‚Ä¶See More. Harry Green Brilliant!. Bob Borrelli yeah fuck that guy and his sophisticated words :D. Who literally invented meteorology.. hey can you link the math paper using emoji? That would be awesome and I'd like to read it.This is a good one about emoji, but it's not written IN it, though it has some examples of retelling. https://www.languageatinternet.org/articles/2019/gawne. Well I am an unattractive, white female and get great reviews and teach  a  subject  that  is considered hard.. perhaps it would be profitable to spend some time studying statistics.. You fulfill one of the categories, then.. Goodüëèüèªforüëèüèªyouüëèüèª. I see you don't understand how studies work. A study never reports that in 100% of cases this happens, and in 0% of cases, this happened. If that were true, providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the study.Studies look at the way things tend to be. Maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but it's not a guarantee one way or the other still.. Funny: race and gender are wwwwaaaayyyyy less important than attractiveness, student interest and discipline, but the first two features in the headline is ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúmale‚Äù. Stop contradicting the facts with your divisive ideology!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Juan Trucupey cool story bro. Catherine Glass it‚Äôs easy to laugh when you‚Äôre the beneficiary. Juan Trucupey that‚Äôs not contradicting facts. It‚Äôs emphasising some things that the study found more than others. But I bet the standard of attractiveness and gender interact as well. Juan yes it's all propaganda; it's not like they're just pointing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the obvious ones. Student interest in the subject influences professor ratings? Really? ü§™. Juan Trucupey You're the one who is claiming that it is sexist against males to imply that gender affects ratings before listing a student's interest in the subject matter. I never said that. So your complaint that I'm contradicting myself is wrong - i‚Ä¶See More. Propaganda, lol.. I literally have had female students look for profs who are called a bitch. It apparently means something different to people. Good to know. Those students just graduating with phds now, one went to Georgetown, another is a teacher..

It's a publishing metaphor.","The drinks you brought with you were made by apprentice mixologists in training working day and night for well below market pay. They were given some incomplete notes by the prior apprentice mixologists and expected to execute the drinks perfectly. The‚Ä¶See More. And if you do not patron this bar several times every year, you are not allowed to work as an academic.. Barmaid 2 : You should have mixed your drinks with orange juice instead of cranberry juice. But those drinks are only acceptable if they are made with gin  from a recipe that other distillers can replicate exactly as well as hand-crafted tonic water from cinchona bark grown by the Agricultural college and sustainably harvested by graduate students working on stipend. üòâ. And students will most likely take a sip of the drink, find the one line they wanna cite, and be done with it.. Abdul Haseeb And gripe that there are multiple FREE gin and tonics in front of them.. you forgot to mention that the person two seats over (the 2nd customer) had a negative opinion of the academic's mixology, and suggested some edits that completely change the composition of the cocktail.. then he is hired and makes this money in a month because his boss simply trust this bar... Editor: it's passed peer review. But someone else for that issue has dropped out and could you rewrite it to about twice length? Oh, and it'll have to go to two different reviewers after that.. Works months or years to prepare the drink*. Daniele Padula it's like if you have to ferment the alcoholic and grow the lemons yourself. Then you have to invent your own drink that has to be slightly different than any drink before.. Daniele Padula exactly my thought! Takes years to make the drink and a few years to get the money to get everything to make those drinks.. This actually exists in real life. You can bring your own drink to a BYOB place and they will charge you an uncorking fee to just sit down and drink it there.. Ne≈üet √ñzel And there's also the equivalent with cake called 'cakeage'. Makes for an exxy cake.. After paying the $3500, the academic may then be contacted by the bar asking if they want to serve drinks (for free) 2 nights a week for the foreseeable future. The academic accepts. It‚Äôs a considerable honour!. Edmund King üòÜ. Reviewer 2: there is no need to clarify that it's a metaphor. Please delete the last line and instead cite a wonderful paper by (reviewer 2, 1989).. Roee Sarel and add a further ¬£1,000 if you want to illustrate your comments in colour!. Add another ‚Ç¨500 for one hard copy of your own paper.. Reviewer 1: the comment clarifying that this is a publishing metaphor has been removed. I feel that this needs to be added so as to provide a stand alone understanding for the naive reader.. Roee Sarel hvae we met?. Roee Sarel Gabriela Rabelo This though^ !!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ When you try and work out who the reviewers are by the papers they suggest xD. Bartender tells the academic they can't drink their drinks till they  format them onto the bar's menu and disclose whether anyone helped them to make the drinks. By then, the ice in the drinks has melted.. The  academic then  pays  to  read  the  labels  on  their  own  bottle.  This  is  also  a publishing  metaphor. Their own ORIGINAL SIGNATURE drinks, with recipes attached.. Then the bar had to shut down since some neighnours claimed they were serving propaganda.. Grammar is poor. Major review ü§£ü§£. Wow.  Just, no.  Not a single person I know in academia who does it right experiences this.  No one.. And them you are asked for by that bar to help others bringing their drinks. Same goes for conferences, with one zero less. This one is truly hilarious!. Or a conference metaphor. Are they published or not? Who cares then?. Melissa Weber-Mayrer. Marissa Rice. Christopher Nichols. Jamie Dillon Farrington. Kate Burn omg! So accurate üòÇ. Alanna Sincovich. Jorge Cebri√°n. Guendalina De Nadai. ‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå ‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏ç‡πà.

Then, you bring to the bar for free and pay them to try it from them.

It works everywhere. Also outside physics and especially outside academia. I have a question? ... well, it's more of a comment.. All the triggered men go. I'm also pretty crap at telling jokes. But maybe your male colleague is more confident and can pull it off.. This comment is actually very sad and frustrating.... Committee meetings. What I said, repeated.. Not true, but if good it's always worth stealing. I‚Äôm 84; been happening forever. In the 60s my husband would ignore my idea, steal it and proudly tell it! Then claim to have no memory of me saying it.Crazy-making. Who needs gaslighting?. My favourite maths and science teachers were both female.. Why would that be Doctor Nellist?. I felt this woman. It's also what it's like being a man or woman and friends with Hamed. Kasra Milad Omid.

pretty sure that is not typical conversation at professional conferences my wife is a professor when she helps the children with their homework she insists her name is put on it as well because they did it in my house my name goes on it too if i agree with the sentiment of the joke but if i describe my own interpretation of it then it is mansplaining all over again i want women to not have to worry about this bullshit and have a great career and life without all of the male insensitivities funny how pervasive this joke is when introducing curricular changes and revisiting course descriptions these are always rejected until an ivy league later releases a press report for the need to change do not know if i should laugh or cry i am 68 and it is been happening forever it is like being invisible came here to repeat it to complete the joke and realized it does not work when i say it it is strange but ever since i was taught both chemistry and physics by two amazing women in high school and then taught many more chemistry classes in college by women professors the idea that women are scientists has never seemed remotely i just read that neil degrasse tyson wants astrophysics to be more popular than beyonce well making the study practice environment more inclusive shall assist with that he peating is so annoying but do you even understand physics or would you like a male commentator from an unrelated field explain it to you first oh you have a phd do you not sure what your point is whyigotout not that math is much better all my best ideas at work stolen by women but yeah okay this is a strictly male thing to do it works everywhere also outside physics and especially outside academia i have a question well it is more of a comment all the triggered men go i am also pretty crap at telling jokes but maybe your male colleague is more confident and can pull it off this comment is actually very sad and frustrating committee meetings what i said repeated not true but if good it is always worth stealing i am 84 been happening forever in the 60s my husband would ignore my idea steal it and proudly tell it then claim to have no memory of me saying it crazy

The only ones surrendering are the progressives if they back Biden. People forget that he was the old, conservative white guy who was supposed to balance out the Obama ticket back when people thought he was progressive. If the left found the Obama years disillusioning then just wait.... Surrender implies they were ever fighting for it!. One good reason I am not a Democrat.. Bernie is not speaking tonight without a deal in place.. That's all centrists know how to do, is surrender. Can't surrender if you don't go in for it to begin with. Insurance is bigger than big oil. It's not possible to get it done in a durable way today.. Yup, not possible when the elected class doesn't want it. We should never accept that and never support anyone who isn't for it.. Democrats:  medicare for all is just not possible in today's political environmentAlso Democrats:  the reason it's not possible. Jason King a reasonable, if defeatist, conclusion.. My opinion has nothing to do with what is physically and monetarily possible, my opinion has more to do with the obtuse nature of the people that stand in its way.. All too ready to surrender to everything, always, everytime. Replace 'Seem All Too Willing' with 'Eager'.. Like always,  it's up to us , not the powers that be. What aren't they willing to surrender?. Can't surrender if you were never fighting to begin with!. ^exactly. Pretty much just gun control üòÇ. their working class hostages. ::shocked pikachu face::. Democrats are basically saying that simply not being Trump makes everything terrible corrupt thing they do acceptable. No pun intended but two wrongs don't make a right. It's not okay that Trump is opposed to Medicare for All and it's not okay that Biden is opposed to Medicare for All.. lf Trump is re-elected? it will be four more years before we have an honest discussion about healthcare as a human, civil right, versus a billable commodity.If BIDEN is elected?  It will be EIGHT years.  ‚Ä¶See More. The DNC is like Lucy with the football. Stop believing differently.. Bullshit. VOTE. VOTE DEMOCRAT.. No back bone. I'm still voting for Biden, but I will keep up the right for national healthcare. I feel the tide is turning even though at a glacial pace.. Why is this magazine so often going against Democrats?  I'd like the learn about your perspective, but it's all about hating on DNC?  I'm happy to learn and advocate for a  Socialist Revolution, or a Social Democracy, with you guys.  But it's as if you can't be bothered to recognize what a shit storm the GOP is.  It's lame.. RM DaVink Jacobin absolutely acknowledges what a shit storm the GOP is, but the mainstream of the Dem party is as well & unwilling to acknowledge the needs and Talent & Abilities of the working class anymore. It is incredibly frustrating to the vast majority of Democrats to be forsaken for just another version viscous and brutal neoliberalism.. There are better places to look for an echo chamber, which is what you seem to want.Yes, the GOP is awful, horrible, terrible and we all recognize it.

RM DaVink If you‚Äôre through with ‚Äúthis magazine‚Äù why keep commenting? Just be through.. It's a socialist publication, so you are going to see a lot of criticism of the Democratic party because they don't share the same politics. You can always tune into CNN, MSNBC, or even other progressive alternative media like Majority Report if you want to hear about how bad the Republican party is.. Things are fucking bad, and they're getting worse. Sorry socialists don't sugarcoat that fact; concern troll elsewhere. If this is too much, imagine what will happen if she reads Capital or the manifesto. RM DaVink Many of the articles are informative about corruption and history,  But you right there's lots of people here that are deranged by anger, and can't see that the Democrats are vastly better, and could be further improved if they became part of the team.. According to Pew, 2019 support for a border wall reached an all time high among Republicans and Republican leaning independents at 63%. Despite intense opposition among Democrats, it was an issue Trump successfully used to excite his base and win in 20‚Ä¶See More. This is common misinformation.  About 2/3 of Americans support voluntary M4A--about 2/3 are against forced M4A.  These polls aren't of voters though--non-voters are far left of the people that vote.|  Jacobin is mostly non-voters.That and money in politics means even the public option will be very uphill.. Bill That is extremely inaccurate. Medicare for All is not a public option. Most polls show Medicare for All well over 50% popularity. More recently it‚Äôs been polling increasingly higher. Even republicans support it at 46%. And it *gains* popularity when people are informed that they can keep their doctors, because people don‚Äôt care about their insurance. They care about their doctors.. Q:Ya know what feeds on the dead and the dying? A: Vultures, hyenas and the USofA medical industrial complex.‚Ä¶See More.

Chris Bullis lemme guess... the green party? DSA? DQFC?. They're counting on the 'anyone but trump' vote and so they don't feel they have to earn your vote now. That didn't work against obama and it won't work against trump. It's just not a magnet for a majority movement. Ideas for the people are!. Stephen Ames I'll bet you don't move to Russia.  If America collapses I hope Western countries don't allow refugees to come if they didn't vote to remove Trump.Regardless your kidding yourself that Democrats are looking for your vote.  They know your ilk won't vote.. Bill Duffe Democrats, thru their nonsense,  make the others appealing in this corrupt 2 party system.. No ‚Äúdemocrat‚Äù has ever said they are for Medicare for all, they have said they would support expanding Obamacare but not doing away with private insurance. Some who suggest they are democrats but are in fact socialists are for full Medicare for all. Pu‚Ä¶See More. Socialists are the worst Economists in human history.

Because it weakens their power over workers.,"They don't need to plan for unemployment, the just progressively eliminate human work in order to increase the profit share in the added value.. Marx explains that capitalists try to maintain a 'reserve army of the unemployed' to keep wages down. Yes and so socialists should make a Universal Job Guarantee at a living wage a transitional demand.. Wally Mooney if the JG is voluntary and is not a job created just to keep people working as a way to justify their earnings or even their lives I'm with you. Jobs should not be linked to wages if we want real freedom.. Will Eede Sure. I fully support the battle for a 4 day week also.. Reduce the working time without decreasing wages.That's what workers have been fighting for (and won) for decades, and that put more people to job.More people employed doesn't necessarily imply more wealth produced. It can also be a better repartition between workers of the time used to produce.. Wally, that was enlightening. Thank you.. shouldn't they like it because then they get to exploit more people?. Hanno Sauer I am not going to exert effort showing to you that your assumptions are just that, not logic. It is just not worth it under these conditions.. Brenton Eccles i will leave it to you to 'establish' that a guaranteed entitlement to X won't affect people's motivation to obtain X. Hanno Sauer That is a valid concern, and I think that is why we should be open to incrementalism, to having degrees of competitiveness in markets, etc. All I know is the current system in the US is far from ideal; the power businesses have over people is far too much.. Hanno Sauer the labour market relies on desperation to create downward pressure on wages: when people lack desperation, either because it's easy to find a new job or because wages are high, it puts that mechanism in jeopardy.. Capitalism requires arbitrage of labor: buying the worker's time cheap; selling the product of that work for more than the labor and materials cost; and pocketing the difference. The lower the standing rate of unemployment, the greater the threat to the capitalist's money machine.. Who says that? Because a polish philosopher suggested it in 1943?   What capitalist has ever said such a ridiculous thing?. Slavery was a full-employment system, so we must be careful what we wish for :/. They also don't offer their employees the option to unionize or participate as co-owners.. Shorter hours without loss of earnings is what we needA three day week would provide opportunity for more employees, with more leisure time, improved mental health  and a greater turnover with regard to production. So are you saying no one could ever be sacked under socialism?. Marcia Meiring We are saying that if you don't work well, you'll get help to work better and experience better working conditions.It also means quitting your job won't get you kicked in the street. You have the right to make mistakes, and not die because of it. We propose not living in the jungle anymore ;p. Yeah üôÑ. http://choldraboldra.blogspot.com/.../aspectos-politicos....

Prisons also needs to be reformed (which functions as a profit industry).. I don't think I'm following your logic. How would you abolish all 'punitive justice' (your words, not sure what you mean by that) but only 'reform' prisons, not abolish them? Wouldn't prisons be a subcategory of 'punitive justice' in your categorizatione. Julianna McCorkle Id agree with some of that.

Every structural problem in this country is because we never hold this one group of people really accountable for anything, honestly, this would be the only case where I feel capital punishment could achieve a broad social good.. As long as they committed a real crime, thats actually listed in the Criminal Code, either State or Federal.ALL criminals need to be accountable.. If they caused harm or injustice, that harm needs to be repaired, that injustice needs to be corrected, regardless of whether theres a piece of paper somewhere calling it a crime..

you got there i bet you think he is rounder than the earth too read anything about jair or bolivia or like castro or like literally read i mean he actually is less conservative than the dnc i do not like the direction he wants to push the country but you cannot deny he is pushing harder than thr dnc pushes for anything the corporate class is not in favour of prosecuting white collar crime and neither are the politicians it funds the first step is to eliminate political donations by corporations but that will be a long hard fight if americans were really opposed to looting they should begin with these white collar looters do not ever expect to find judicial prosecution of those thugs the french solution is the answer shouldnt we be abolishing prisons not filling them will m hall there is a massive difference between upstream and downstream crimes and we need to focus on these upstream corporate and white collar crimes that feed inequality and insecurity that cause the street crimes that are rightly identified as over incarcerated if they are lucky the corporatocracy having dispensed with rule of law invites sharper retribution sin is sin and crime is crime the judge should be your concern what is throwing them in jail gonna do lmao going to jail does not make people accountable for anything it is been said that uk businesses claimed money under the job retention scheme and used it to pay their shareholders that would be a good place to start that is why no one blinked an eye when stone and manafort were released prison is not harsh enough for many of these people lol we can be confident this will not happen while biden is president neoliberal capitalism is criminally corrupt is not the left against the mass incarceration for non violent offences that feeds prison industrialization ahmed o j abdul nah having the sheriff put you on the street because they sold you a fraudulent mortgage is non violent if people did not want to get victimized by crooked bankers they would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and be more predatory themselves byron spencer white collar crime is non voilent you can be a victim without being harmed physically brett norris i am open to non carceral solutions but some solution that is a deterrent is required something that prevents future abuse and gives restitution to victims i am in full support the school to prison pipeline provided that the schools in question are mba programs glen carpenter yup start with harvard and yale pamela taylor horton wharton school of business at university of pennsylvania trumps alma mater first glen carpenter and management we also need thousands more irs agents they pay for themselves and regulators of all industry and business and hr departments that actually side with employees again peter breschard if the government wanted to do that they would they do not want to even your article points out the irs needs more funding to properly audit the wealthy you need to read beyond the headlinr yes yes yes gr8 investment it seems after enron they found making people accountable was too hard on the economy that is why they steal billions and only are fined millions to protect the jobs of people why not pay back every dollar they took plus a little more i when they scream law and order they do not mean justice the law oppresses the masses with order and protects the crimes of the ruling elite that negatively impact society the most the law is unjust in it is application of who the full power of the law goes after and who it ignores b b but what about the job creators you are just jealous you envy their success you will take away incentive to work you will make them want to leave me hang them all amen amen amen we need justice for too long it has been excused there is no incentive for doing the right thing anymore no abolish prisons yeah like cheating corrupt trump what happened to prison abolitionists lol wait i thought we needed to abolishprison ca l blomster abolish prison and death penalty to white colar crimes the united states doesnt give a shit about crime but where to start hmm lock em up anywhere yes please sloppy headline on an otherwise so so piece it is disappointing to see a publication like jacobin casually and thoughtlessly advocating for jail when america is finally coming around to prison abolition i say that as a reader a fan and a leftist julianna mccorkle prison abolition is a stupid proposal punitive justice and the bail system should be abolished alltogether prisons also needs to be reformed which functions as a profit industry i do not think i am following your logic how would you abolish all punitive justice your words not sure what you mean by that but only reform prisons not abolish them would not prisons be a subcategory of punitive justice in your categorizatione julianna mccorkle id agree with some of that but ordering fines and restitutions dont seem to be doing a good job of keeping high level corporate bad actors from committing malfeasance on large scales we get that the dnc is awful but these people are criminals unlike anything we might have seen in modern american history trump and anyone involved with his administration need to be thoroughly investigated and charged if and or when any wrongdoing is found chris winter not a single banker went to federal prison for 2008 to act like democrats want to stamp out corruption is a farce what you really desire is punishment based on political leanings matthew dahlberg i dont think so actually i dont see how you reached that conclusion at all obviously the issues transcend obama and trump and every other president which is exactly the point that im making op is saying that the trump oh sorry i guess i read it as just blaming obama when you were blaming the whole system my b dude i think the disappearance of numerous citizens and the use of military force against citizens is a big difference i would say trumps recommendation to shoot looters and squeeze out voting rights is different the democrats suck but let us not pretend trump does not wish to be a dictator every structural problem in this country is because we never hold this one group of people really accountable for anything honestly this would be the only case where i feel capital punishment could achieve a broad social good as long as they committed a real crime thats actually listed in the criminal code either state or federal all criminals need to be accountable if they caused harm or injustice that harm needs to be repaired that injustice needs to be corrected regardless of whether theres a piece of paper somewhere calling it a crime seems like they have a similar immunity as do the police funny how that works eh him and

Marxist Rudolf Hilferding produced an influential analysis of capitalism, and he played an active role in Austrian and German politics before falling victim to Nazism. He still has a lot to teach us about the way modern capitalism works.","‚ÄúThe individualism of the bourgeois economists had prevented them from understanding that the labor theory of value was much more than an analysis of relative prices. Since labor is the social bond uniting an atomized society, the Marxian theory of value is a statement about the social relations underlying market phenomena, not a mere theorem about prices.‚Äù üíØ.

Um, wasn't Hilferding's failure to consider reforms to capitalism to deal with the economic crisis as the depression deepened one of the factors that enabled Hitlers rise to power? Didn't he reject a program similar to what was happening in Sweden and the US at the time on the grounds that such reformism was insufficiently marxist? Is that not quite damning in hindsight?. Not at all. His failure was refusing to support the KPD and for opposing the merger of the USPD with the KPD. He was not sufficiently Marxist, even if he was smart enough to reject Keynsian half-measures.. Christofer Koch Those Keynesian half-measures likely prevented fascism in the US and Sweden, and were not implemented in Germany. Instead, the SPD including Hilfering in practice went for AUSTERITY. We all know the lessons of austerity fueling fascism today, and yet you excuse it historically when done in the name of marxism?.

One more reason to vote blue. David Lopez. Penny Roberts and we pray Biden stays the journey, but Harris would be a GREAT PRRSIDENT.. Buddy Zapata you‚Äôre a racist sentiment.. For decades the choice of picking Vice Presidents depended on bucking conventional wisdom. But in spite of several well qualified candidates, Joe chose to go with conventional wisdom... and surprised everyone. Peter Grimaldi I highly doubt Joe made the decision.. She also sat on Catholic priest prosecutions as the SF District Attorney. There 41 accused and being investigated by her predecessor.. I agree. A dynamic public speaker. Unfortunately I disagree with almost all of her stated positions.  She will very likely become President.  If we lose the Senate, God Help Us.. Well, take a look at CEO's of some major corporations and other larger businesses and you will find many men well into their 80's still going strong , making world changing decisions everyday. Get off the age subject of Joe Biden! Start thinking ahead more positively!!!!!!. Sometimes we who believe in facts and science and competent journalism just need to sit back and let these other folks be wrong. And we shouldn‚Äôt respond to obvious bots and vapid puppets.. Biden is courting the moderates n never Trump Conservatives rather than Progressives Bold choice .. Democrats should stay positive n celebrate n embrace the choice... My worry is that on the first debate with Pence, Pence is just gonna open apart his suit jacket and flash her with a tshirt that has Tulsi's face printed on it....... Harris is at best a mental lightweight who has enough baggage to require 4-5 baggage handlers. At worst, a closeted neo-Marxist who‚Äôll abrogate constitutionally guaranteed rights with no second thoughts. Vote accordingly. Horrible woman. But if we can keep the democrats from cheating with mass mail ballots Trump will win in a landslide. I predict California will go red. People there are tired of tyranny..

But to say that picking a woman of color as VP is the ‚Äúsafe choice‚Äù kinda flies against and ignoring the history of sexism and racism in our country‚Äôs history. Sounds like a bold choice to me. And if it‚Äôs true that she represents a safe choice, then I suppose we have come a long way my friends.. You guys are a desperate group of humans to come up with this stuff, do you really hate that much?. That aye a lot for the rest of the choices if she‚Äôs the best choices.

The establishment has the momentum, but Biden needs to prove himself to voters!. Mike - I have no idea where you would get such an idea.. That's just totally totally wrong and a lie.

Mike Paine, vote for Trump/Pence then!. Soooo,  If the presidential candidate is not viable, potentially, what does that say for the ticket? Why not nominate a viable presidential candidate ? Is this a circus or a presidential race?. Around the same real ages of Trump and Hillary . Trump's probably older.. She's a vile, odious woman and it is the antithesis of what the democrats should be doing right now.. Biden/Harris 2020. Vote Blue!.

Pence will not sit at a table with a woman unless his wife is present.. Oh shut up.  She gave him the best odds at winning, and that's ALL that mattered in the decision. Who writes this nonsense?. Which isn't Kamla, if you're looking at how she was received during the primary. A wiser choice would have been Warren. Although, I was holding out for Karen bass..

conventional wisdom and surprised everyone peter grimaldi i highly doubt joe made the decision she also sat on catholic priest prosecutions as the sf district attorney there 41 accused and being investigated by her predecessor i agree a dynamic public speaker unfortunately i disagree with almost all of her stated positions she will very likely become president if we lose the senate god help us well take a look at ceos of some major corporations and other larger businesses and you will find many men well into their 80s still going strong making world changing decisions everyday get off the age subject of joe biden start thinking ahead more positively sometimes we who believe in facts and science and competent journalism just need to sit back and let these other folks be wrong and we should not respond to obvious bots and vapid puppets biden is courting the moderates n never trump conservatives rather than progressives bold choice democrats should stay positive n celebrate n embrace the choice my worry is that on the first debate with pence pence is just gonna open apart his suit jacket and flash her with a tshirt that has tulsis face printed on it harris is at best a mental lightweight who has enough baggage to require 4 5 baggage handlers at worst a closeted neo marxist who will abrogate constitutionally guaranteed rights with no second thoughts vote accordingly horrible woman but if we can keep the democrats from cheating with mass mail ballots trump will win in a landslide i predict california will go red people there are tired of tyranny they will do great together wait until we see the cabinet and plans for first 100 days wow throw those trite words and phrases around i have watched and listened to her her questions are on point she owns it ok i get the point but to say that picking a woman of color as vp is the safe choice kinda flies against and ignoring the history of sexism and racism in our countrys history sounds like a bold choice to me and if it is true that she represents a safe choice then i suppose we have come a long way my friends you guys are a desperate group of humans to come up with this stuff do you really hate that much that aye a lot for the rest of the choices if she is the best choices she is for illegal aliens rights and prison rights but not the law abiding the guy who wrote this piece must love hearing himself talk what a blowhard and thus you are a tool how do all these throwbacks keep finding their way to the brookings page would not they have to be able to spell it mike paine it is obvious you do not know what it is to be a nazi or a fascists or an authoritarian reagan was an older man when he ran for president and again ran for second term between her and biden we will finally see the swamp get drained name calling now that will change a thinking mind right the establishment has the momentum but biden needs to prove himself to voters mike i have no idea where you would get such an idea that is just totally totally wrong and a lie she has less than 1 term of experience in the senate with no important legislative accomplishments she is very liberal she comes from a non swing state where biden was already ahead her previous she is more than plausible intellectual heavyweight compared to anything trumponian it is comforting to see someone take the job of governing america so seriously if you want to spit on medicare for all and black lives matter in stereo mike paine vote for trump pence then soooo if the presidential candidate is not viable potentially what does that say for the ticket why not nominate a viable presidential candidate is this a circus or a presidential race around the same real ages of trump and hillary trumps probably older she is a vile odious woman and it is the antithesis of what the democrats should be doing right now biden harris 2020 vote blue experience knowledge education energy more than safe it is exciting tim kaine was safe gretchen whitmer would have been safe you do realize that your comment is your opinion only and carries no more or no less weight than any other opinion in my opinion much much less weight and the donald is only two years behind she is an intelligent woman it boils down to whether you support that teams ideas on how to run the country or not most experienced at what yeah but explanations are supposed to make things less perplexing when the party comradship becomes so large so big so dominating its no longer relevant who they nominate for office they are just figure heads for party implementation of thier programs hooman beings are irrevelant when the goal is control and wapo the mouthpiece of the left mental lightweight you just wait and see mike p seems like a show off marxism is so outdated look at all these miserable haters seriously did you see her polling numbers in the presidential primaries a very solid choice as a concerned 81 yr old i feel that the man upstairs works in mysterious ways and joe did the right thing pence will not sit at a table with a woman unless his wife is present oh shut up she gave him the best odds at winning and that is all that mattered in the decision who writes this nonsense which is not kamla if you are looking at how she was received during the primary a wiser choice would have been warren although i was holding out for karen bass there is no plausible democrat president i would feel safe with her as president she does not seem prone to hysteria ,"['choice', 'biden', 'vote', 'trump', 'joe', 'woman', 'right', 'presidential', 'safe', 'mike',

Some beneficial parts of Obamacare are still in effect, Trump will get rid of those too, if he wins. You've been duped.. Lon Koykkari All Democrat Governors. I think they did it on purpose. Or, are they that stupid?  Killing off the elderly saves them money.. Brent D Amundson Gee, Obama doesnt seem real worried about any indictments, hasn't mentioned a hoax or witch hunt yet.  Trump is and always will be impeached, he just didn't get removed because of a spineless Senate.  They knew if they called any witnesses they would have to perjure themselves.. Brent D Amundson you must live in a state who didn't embrace Obamacare, my state did and I have low premiums and low deductibles. Do you you get coverage through your employer?. The name Jones ring a bell?  They said the Koolaid was to die for.  I assume Trump's favorite flavor is orange.  To match his skin.....

these are smoke screens to keep yall believing they are human beings like yall and have the same interest as yall these elites are hybrid alienoids in a human sleeve there purpose is to play around with al these things they say trump does his staff writes and they stamp his name not even a little surprised by this just shows how utterly compromised trump is this is a waste of airspace we have 130 000 covid deaths among millions of other headlines it is clear that many of the people making comments did not read the article the letter is from 2007 smh this is embarrassing putin is extremely capable leader but this clown trump is literally kissing his ass and puts us second to maybe even 3rd behind russia and china we are better than this election time putins in the picture again and that is how the lovebirds met trump sold his soul to russia he is a russian agent forbes is now wreaking of desperation and it sure does show putin times person of the year trumps puppet oh dear mad at trump but not time for the selection putin puts bounties on american solders heads and pos trump congratulates him wtf master and servant omg the horror and we have had russian premieres visit the midwest back in the 60s your point is hes been borrowing money from them for decades of course he called him trump gives putin slow deep neck in the back of a presidential limo melania cant satisfy him like putin can of course he is all tied up with golden shower issues back in 2007 forbes you are quickly turning into garbage was it in crayon you libtards are puppets to the democraps birds of feather why did not times give hilter person of the year award also so maybe its time to defund times magazine and all the fake news outlets time had hitler on their person of the year many decades ago so sounds like a problem with time themselves gave him a nice blow nob too republicans would rather believe russians than actual americans wipe yer mouth you got a little putin on it actually giving biden the medal of honor who deserves it more a man with dementia on the ticket for president of the united states an amazing accomplishment that only could happen with the help of the democrats another non journalist from the dying rag forbes comes up with something from 2007 and believes it to be relevant somehow another forbes sucks again today moment lol forbes is sad trumpy is

Barbara Sausville Johnson dont forget now trying to profit from all those deaths, makes a nice story i guess.. Keith Price Troll. An uneducated one at that!. Keith Price reading that realize stupidity has no limits. I'm sure this will be 100% Accurate and Mention how NY still has the HIGHEST NUMBER of DEATHS!!!Give me a BREAK!  SUCCESS by what measure!  In his LITTLE MIND!. Donald Furr They had the highest because we didn‚Äôt know how to treat the disease at that point. We were trying the damn hydroxychloroquine which proved to be ineffective.  Fortunately, the rest of the country learns from their failures and successes.. Donald Furr and what did you do to help?. Donald Furr you seem like an ultra snowflake.  Calm down. Dolly Tewelis DePagter nice try Blame Trump!  Noone tried hydroxychloroquine in NY!  Your Liberal dumbass leaders were too busy sending infected people into nursing homes and crying/bitching about everything!  Highest Number of Deaths that is on Cuomo!!!. Donald Furr You must be a troll üòÇüòÇ. Angie Dixon tough measures? Like signing a law that forces COVID patients into nursing homes?. Donald Furr TROLL. Ordering positive Covid patients into nursing homes was not Trumps fault.. Two words: nursing homes!!. Says the man who has killed so many in NYC by his lack of leadership,intelligence and forcing nursing homes to take covid patients.  Also blocking any investigation into his murdering of innocent nursing home people.. Cuomo sentenced almost  20,000 people to their death in nursing homes, The old and most vulnerable among us had no power to stop Cuomo from mandating nursing homes admit Covid positive people. There were thousands of COVID-19 specific beds that the infected people could have recovered in at the arena, hospitals, and the Navy ship.  So about 20,000 people lost their lives because of Cuomo‚Äôs malfeasance.. Good he can explain why he murdered over 6,000 seniors in nursing homes with his mandate.. So he forced nursing homes to take covid patients. Last number I read, was 11k deaths in nursing homes...in his state of New York. People then try to open an investigation on that and he blocks it...obviously to cover up his massive mistake. Is that what he‚Äôs claiming leadership looks like? What a joke this guy is.. He literally killed thousands with his poor leader ship and decisions in policymaking look at Florida same amount of cases a 10th of the death. What's it called how to kill the most vulnerable? And then say I did a great job. so a man in office is publishing a book detailing government practices during a pandemic that killed millions is gonna profit from all this death and fear?? And he's aloud?. That was his plan all along once  COVID-19  showed up in New York and I bet Freddo his bother  will be the ghostwriter of his book.. Will he be talking about decimating the NY economy in the face of this pandemic?Cuomo is a joke.. It was Cuomos fault that he did not take measures to enforce strict quarantine and face masks, reduce movement and transport to reduce infection. No wo der NY has the highest rates of infection and deaths in the world.. I hope he will confess in the book how hydroxychloroquine cured his brother ... but he continues discrediting the cheap med that can save lives. Does it include him infecting nursing homes? Or the collapse of Americas largest city? NY is headed for collapse under Cuomo and DeBlasios watch. Step one, keep everything open and encourage life to go on. Step two, close everything and blame President for keeping  everything open. Step three, force nursing homes to take known cases of the virus knowing they lack the ability to isolate and car‚Ä¶See More. He‚Äôs clearly got plenty of free time since he doesn‚Äôt actually make any decisions himself.. Highest death rate of all states-great success story. All is a statistical game to fit his political agendas  and keep merdia fed with garbage.. A what NOT TO DO instruction manual.. He is crying for money ,he is going to need it with all the lawsuits from the seniors family members.. Will he talk about having money ties that made him mandate the elderly that tested positive return to their nursing home causing a lot of death all alone. So glad Florida knows how to take care of our elderly. He was the worst in the country lol. So capitalising off of death by selling books... I'm sorry but both sides are fucking useless...... For  those  new  yorkers  and  califonians  relocating  to  red  states  please  make  sure  you  leave  behind  ur  liberal and  stupid  mentality behind  .... With his experience, I hope his book is on ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù!!!. Will it include how he put COVID patients in nursing homes, which killed thousands and then he blamed it on others? Prospering on the death of others is sickening.. Will it be titled, How Democrats let me get away with murder.. Can always be used as Doorstop. You people realize cuomo can be trash and still be speaking the truth when it comes to trump right?. Re-writing history, by the FX channel oops no Cuomo has its own science fiction channel.. No one to blame for NY other than yourself and DiBlasio.. Is he going to tell how he killed.the elderly in nursing homes.. New York has the highest death toll in the country  üôÑ. Don‚Äôt forget to tell them about all the nursing home deaths for which you are responsible. That‚Äôs REAL leadership ‚Äì thinning the herd.. It wasnt that great..he worried about dearhs..but not deaths by abortion. Cartoon picture book? Hopefully comes with a lesson on state responsibility and a four pack of crayons.. Front cover of book should have a giant Q-tip shoved up his nose by his brother.  Great humor after the death of so many.. Maybe he can explain how NY was destroyed. No wonder he sucked at the handling of it...!? He was busy writing a book on how well he handled it!üòÇüòÇ. You literally had the worst outcomes of any state.  What a self absorbed a hole. ‚ÄúMy Little Book on How to Destroy the Greatest City in the World  in 6 Months‚Äù. A retrospective on murder,  mayhem, crime and corruption. It‚Äôs going to be a NY Times best seller. Chapter 1 -Killing the Elderly.. A comic book?. Sounds like a ‚ÄúHorror Story‚Äù. Of course it‚Äôs more likely a FICTION story since we know many of the true events.. I wonder if it mentions how he's concurrently working to cut Medicaid while giving tax breaks to help facilitate these cuts during the pandemic.. A comedy of errors?. Is there a chapter on how he killed thousands of elderly?. Is that what he‚Äôs been working on instead of taking leadership?. Ah folks, perhaps you might want to check on the numbers that have died, are dying, will die, in YOUR STATE.. The guy with the most deaths in his state? This is liberal insanity at its finest.. Look at your state.  You should not be bragging!",52,"['die', 'chapter', 'bet', 'take', 'situation', 'movement', 'infection', 'include', 'political', 'law', 'state', 'story', 'proof', 'problem', 'brother', 'game', 'help',

Brian Miller well I didn‚Äôt know the state was going to possess all your belongings and afford you some shack for your family to live in. So that‚Äôs what Bernie is up to?

Hopefully the Republican Party will come back more to his way of thinking!. Judy Bass Richardson no way he‚Äôs bitter because the republicans voted against him.  He‚Äôs not for Biden he‚Äôs anti Trump. Joe Hall you're going to need an extra adult diaper in November. Holly McCool Rice 8645!. Judy Bass Richardson no more RINOs.. He's not a Republican.

Who needs that kind of thinking?. Holly McCool Rice Right on!20 for treason and 20 for obstruction!. Why are Republicans speaking at the Democratic convention!!! No one wants to hear that!. Mr. Kasich and Mr. Sanders represent the heart and sole of the now defunct USSR, oh they they also share a common campaign donor - The Soros Family. Enjoy our leftovers. Might add a little depth to a dying party.. The democrats need to stop trying to be the republican party. The country doesn't need two consetvative parties. That's why their a bunch of loosers..

Who would even really watch this is he really going to come out of the basement. The only people who like this guy are Democrats who agree with he's saying. Losers attract losers. Sanders has twice forfeited what was his. Great leader he is for sure. Kasich couldn‚Äôt even win his own state in the primary - can‚Äôt get much more pathetic than that.. Thank you for stepping up and putting the country first.. Kasich would have been a great President ..Top notch person.. Just join their party Kasich, it's that simple.  You're already on their team Teeing up Socialism.  Disgraceful.. This is the election to not think in terms of traditional party lines.

I'd have more success digging up the entire state of Ohio and moving it to the coast.. The irony of a Chinese magazine announcing a RINO announcing support for Biden support is outstanding. ü§î. Even the Republicans can see how worthless Trump is.. Unstable He can't make up his mind. They won't let biden leave the basement. Politics makes strange bedfellows.. I would have voted for him last election! Moderate views and knows bipartisan is the only way to move this country forward united!. Evil !From the Dark Swamp !!!. He may find a seat in the cabinet.  That would be crushing blow to Republicans. The Democrats have broadened their support as the Republicans become the party of the Klan and curly Qanon. Lining up the comedians and traitors.. Kasich is the man to do it, he is a true lying Democrat in a Rhino suit. Just don‚Äôt be a sheep.. Disappointed with the DNC, Kasich and this crew are not considered influential outside the liberal wing of the RNC and independents.. Kasich is a sore loser and a life long politician.. Country over party.... Will Mitt Romney be showcased too? The problem with neocons is they are too vain and full of themselves to notice that both sides despise them. Enjoy your 15 minutes. And finally, go away!. Maybe Kasich can run as a moderate Democrat next cycle.. You are a presidential candidate loser  who cares what you say not changing  my mind. Trump 2020!.

He‚Äôs always been a good guy regardless of party.. He still cannot get over he is a loser and no one cares what he says!!!  Worst Governor Ohio ever had.  When he speaks I will wager that the evening viewership ratings will drop off the chart.. Shows the depth of the Swamp.Forbes, you didn't think this through.

Your lack of leadership, lack of statesmanship, compassion and intelligence and your childlike mentality have moved me to never support you again'.Sane America..

I would suggest and advice everybody to have a balanced running routine to avoid injury.. Left over right, right over left stretches prior to running will fifx the IT band pain.  Cross your feet over each other, bend at the waist.  Lean to either side until you feel the slight pull down the IT band.. Jeff Harris thanks i will do these streches, i feel pain mostly when i bend the knee otherwise it is normal. Why is ice skating ranked so high?? They should qualify that by saying competitive figure skating.  Slowly going around Rockefeller Plaza seems less strenuous than vacuuming.. I have to agree with this; I‚Äôve lost 80 pounds and during that time I tracked which one made me lose weight the most; I tried HIIT, Swimming, Biking, Boxing, Muay Thai, Dutch Style Kickboxing. And out of all of them, the one that made me lose weight was running 5 miles a day.. Running is cruel and unusual punishment. üò£üòÇ. If you want to lose weight quickly, stop over eating.  Most people consume entirely too many calories for their sedentary lifestyle.. Swimming is the best. It burns more calories than jogging and it isn't harmful to your joints. I doubt their numbers are correct. Want to be even more efficient? Alternate between swimming and cycling.. Exercise is only 30% effective compared to diet. 3000 calories loses 1 lb.. I used to run till I injured my knee. Now I power walk 6 kmüòé. The body doesn't burn calories, it exhales them.. Walking is just as good for the same distance covered.. It‚Äôs actually jiu jitsu but nice try!!!. Only for masochists.. It's very very true.. Jogging is so boring. B O R I N G!. Jumping over ironing boards?. 20-40 mins in between the sheets is best.

At the time, Garvey led the largest, in the millions, and most unified Black/Negro activist collective in the Western world. A feat, to date, no one has ever duplicated. In contrast, feeling less relevant and jealous of Garvey, Du Bois, an ‚Äúintellectual,‚Äù resorted to racist, White beauty standard inspired name-calling. Years later, much too late for Garvey to benefit, who had since died (he was eventually set-up and deported), after it became crystal clear to Du Bois that his belief in White benevolent partnership with Black liberation struggle was flawed, he would regret how he treated Garvey.  He finally had to admit to himself that Garvey was right, and, contaminated by Whiteness, he was wrong.  A part of how Du Bois atoned for his behavior was to leave his so-called high-brow academic perch, and move to Ghana, West Africa.  He became a true Pan Africanist, living the rest of his life surrounded by first-blood Africans, that he realized were quite beautiful.   Today, we can all honor Dr. Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr.","DuBois really made a huge shift from his liberalism to embracing Pan-Africanism and communism. He even had a good laugh with Mao.

On November 14, 1848 3, sailed, from Cork harbor alone: 147 bales of bacon, 120 casks and 135 barrels of pork, 5 casks of hams, 149 casks of miscellaneous provisions (foodstuff); 1,996 sacks & 950 barrels of oats; 300 bags of flour; 300 head of cattle; 239 sheep; 9,398 firkins of butter; 542 boxes of eggs.  On July 28, 1848 4; a typical day's food shipments from only the following four ports: from Limerick: the ANN, JOHN GUISE and MESSENGER for London; the PELTON CLINTON for Liverpool; and the CITY OF LIMERICK, BRITISH QUEEN, and CAMBRIAN MAID for Glasgow. This one-day removal of Limerick's food was of 863 firkins of butter; 212 firkins, 1,198 casks and 200 kegs of lard, 87 casks of ham; 267 bales of bacon; 52 barrels of pork; 45 tons and 628 barrels of flour; 4,975 barrels of oats and 1,000 barrels of barley.  From Kilrush: the ELLEN for Bristol; the CHARLES G. FRYER and MARY ELLIOTT for London. This one-day removal was of 550 tons of County Clare's oats and 15 tons of its barley.  From Tralee: the JOHN ST. BARBE, CLAUDIA and QUEEN for London; the SPOKESMAN for Liverpool. This one-day removal was of 711 tons of Kerry's oats and 118 tons of its barley.  From Galway: the MARY, VICTORIA, and DILIGENCE for London; the SWAN and UNION for Limerick (probably for transshipment to England). This one-day removal was of 60 sacks of Co. Galway's flour; 30 sacks and 292 tons of its oatmeal; 294 tons of its oats; and 140 tons of its miscellaneous provisions (foodstuffs). British soldiers forcibly removed it from its starving Limerick, Clare, Kerry and Galway producers.  In Belmullet, Co. Mayo the mission of 151 soldiers 5 of the 49th Regiment, in addition to escorting livestock and crops to the port for export, was to guard a few tons of stored meal from the hands of the starving; its population falling from 237 to 105 between 1841 and 1851. Belmullet also lost its source of fish in January, 1849, when Britain's Coast Guard arrested its fleet of enterprising fishermen ten miles at sea in the act of off-loading flour from a passing ship. They were sentenced to prison and their currachs were confiscated. The Waterford Harbor British army commissariat officer wrote to British Treasury Chief Charles Trevelyan on April 24, 1846; ""The barges leave Clonmel once a week for this place, with the export supplies under convoy which, last Tuesday, consisted of 2 guns, 50 cavalry, and 80 infantry escorting them on the banks of the Suir as far as Carrick."" While its people starved, the Clonmel district exported annually, along with its other farm produce, approximately 60,000 pigs in the form of cured pork.","Physically painful to remember.

Lee Ann Sigmon-Farley he was having brain bleeds , on blood thinners, was in ICU in June for many days then got released to file a lawsuit against his niece, apparently had a fall and last 2 weeks couldn't speak, so got readmitted to the hospital again to die within 24 hrs (Donald went to say goodbye for 45 minutes on Friday then went back to his scheduled events)! Apparently it was Strokes!. Carolyn Franklin he went. He did that with daddys will when dear old daddy died.. Carolyn Franklin wow that was Biden's son to a t thx. Judith Scobee thanks.. Trump went to the movies when his brothers was dying. He went golfing when this brother was dying. No mention of hi. Going to the funeral.. Unfortunately he still has supporters, they think just like him!! I can't understand how any person with a heart and a brain that works would do that!!!. This is crazy and wrong. I worry about children whose first memories of a president is this rude, ranting buffoon.. At least her speech wasn't  plagiarized!Sick OLD MAN needs to go home and cuddle up with a blanket in his rocking chair.. He is senile.  Michelle Obama is an esteemed grad of a few prestigious schools.  I bet she'd share her grades.  Classy lady.  Maybe Natasha will have a harder time aPlagerizzing from a recorded speech.. Be Best, donnie!!! Your 3rd current wife, won't  like it!!. He mocks everyone! Including the handicap! His sheep still doesn't see it!ü§î. Trump goes after anyone who has class, anyone who is a popular Democratic political figure, anyone who is intelligent and anyone whose name is OBAMA!  Poor unhinged TRUMP possess NONE of these characteristics.. Donald vicious dog trump has released his kennel of  vicious barking dogs, lots of noise, very little bites. Here's why trump will always be the dumbest person in the room. ALWAYS.üòé. What the hell is wrong with him??? I felt compassion for him cause his brother died but he makes that impossible to do.. totally unglued...why doesn't someone care about him enough to get him help???. more delusional rants from a man who lives in his own fantasy world. He can say all the crap he wants but it won't change the fact that she has more class in her little pinky than he will ever know.. When you have no facts to back yourself up, you point fingers and blame - it's been the hallmark of his presidency - quite the legacy!!  Ineptitude to the max!. He is always making fun of somebody. He is a bully üò°. Hey diaper Don con we the American people watched while 175,000 America people died while you did your week long photo opts and your weekend golfing. TRUMPERY NO LEADERSHIP.. bully in chief is this so called president and he so does not like anyone smarter then him which most people are. He attacks what he can't be and he can't get close to Michelle's level.. He cares only about himself. Wake up people he shows all of you everyday. You want someone like this for your President. Not me.Vote Blue!. He can never be courgel or just nice the world hates ugliness in every shape or form.  May God give him what he deserves. Now he's going after his predecessor's wife.  He's really losing it.. She has more Class than the present would be occupant. This man has nothing better to do than berate people! Such a little man! He has no business being in the WH!. He is constantly mocking people he can't control.  She is a strong, intelligent woman and she scares him.. Always criticizing someone, never stops! What a hateful human being!. You are the biggest caword and incompetent to ever hold the highest office of the land! Michelle is more educated than your entire corrupt family.. His brother A.K.A 'best friend' just passed away  two day's ago and THAT can't even get him to  forget what an ass he is for 5 minutes and say something nice! An ant has more sympathy for people then he does. He has lost most of his base now. They can‚Äôt bear his rubbish.. Maybe Michelle should tell him not to worry about her speech, she‚Äôll send the tape over to Melania üòÇ. HE ISN'T FIT TO SHINE MICHELLE'S SHOES. AS A SUPPOSED PRESIDENT, HE IS SUPPOSED TO BRING THE NATION TOGETHER. INSTEAD, HE IS GOLFING, LYING, INSULTING PEOPLE HE DOESN'T KNOW, OR PLAYING WITH HIMSELF.. THE MOST IGNORANT PRESIDENT EVER GOING AFTER OBAMA WIFE, SHE IS MUCH MORE EDUCATED THAN YOU AND YOUR FAMILY PUT TOGETHER.. He has a heartfelt hatred for strong women, especially women of color.. Isn't he supposed to be grieving for his brother?. He obsesses over the Obama's!  He'll never measure up to any former presidents, even the very bad ones.....and I thought it couldn't get any more disgusting than Nixon.. Someone slap a straight jacket and handcuffs on the orange menace already. He‚Äôs worse than the pandemic.. He just plain hates and is intimidated by strong, intelligent women!. Does he do anything besides mock people?. Someone is running scared so they run their mouth and vomit all over the country ü§Æ.. He gets more stupid by the day. ü§Æ. We have her back, but as you all know he can‚Äôt touch her.. I am sorry as a supposedly grown man that yOu are still a childish bully!. It really tells you alot when they have top Republicans  speaking at the Democratic convention.. Why in the H do people think this is acceptable behavior from a President??. So tired of this repetitious whining and lying and demeaning of women, just go away January 20th!  Far, far away!. I‚Äôd pay a shitload of money to watch a debate between Michelle and Melania!!. I want a decent person as potus. Not someone who committed treason to be placed in the office in the first place. He should be disqualified to run again. ...and the mud=slinging continues.  It is really sad when the negative comments are all you have got.. He makes fun of everyone. Only thing he knows how to do. Certainly can‚Äôt lead intelligently.. Can this man not do anything besides name calling. I agree!  He is no role model for children!

readmitted to the hospital again to die within 24 hrs donald went to say goodbye for 45 minutes on friday then went back to his scheduled events apparently it was strokes carolyn franklin he went he did that with daddys will when dear old daddy died carolyn franklin wow that was bidens son to a t thx judith scobee thanks trump went to the movies when his brothers was dying he went golfing when this brother was dying no mention of hi going to the funeral unfortunately he still has supporters they think just like him i cannot understand how any person with a heart and a brain that works would do that this is crazy and wrong i worry about children whose first memories of a president is this rude ranting buffoon at least her speech was not plagiarized sick old man needs to go home and cuddle up with a blanket in his rocking chair he is senile michelle obama is an esteemed grad of a few prestigious schools i bet she would share her grades classy lady maybe natasha will have a harder time aplagerizzing from a recorded speech be best donnie your 3rd current wife will not like it he mocks everyone including the handicap his sheep still does not see it trump goes after anyone who has class anyone who is a popular democratic political figure anyone who is intelligent and anyone whose name is obama poor unhinged trump possess none of these characteristics donald vicious dog trump has released his kennel of vicious barking dogs lots of noise very little bites heres why trump will always be the dumbest person in the room always what the hell is wrong with him i felt compassion for him cause his brother died but he makes that impossible to do totally unglued why does not someone care about him enough to get him help more delusional rants from a man who lives in his own fantasy world he can say all the crap he wants but it will not change the fact that she has more class in her little pinky than he will ever know when you have no facts to back yourself up you point fingers and blame it is been the hallmark of his presidency quite the legacy ineptitude to the max he is always making fun of somebody he is a bully hey diaper don con we the american people watched while 175 000 america people died while you did your week long photo opts and your weekend golfing trumpery no leadership bully in chief is this so called president and he so does not like anyone smarter then him which most people are he attacks what he cannot be and he cannot get close to michelles level he cares only about himself wake up people he shows all of you everyday you want someone like this for your president not me vote blue he can never be courgel or just nice the world hates ugliness in every shape or form may god give him what he deserves now he is going after his predecessors wife he is really losing it she has more class than the present would be occupant this man has nothing better to do than berate people such a little man he has no business being in the wh he is constantly mocking people he cannot control she is a strong intelligent woman and she scares him always criticizing someone never stops what a hateful human being you are the biggest caword and incompetent to ever hold the highest office of the land michelle is more educated than your entire corrupt family his brother a k a best friend just passed away two days ago and that cannot even get him to forget what an ass he is for 5 minutes and say something nice an ant has more sympathy for people then he does he has lost most of his base now they cannot bear his rubbish maybe michelle should tell him not to worry about her speech she will send the tape over to melania he is not fit to shine michelles shoes as a supposed president he is supposed to bring the nation together instead he is golfing lying insulting people he does not know or playing with himself the most ignorant president ever going after obama wife she is much more educated than you and your family put together he has a heartfelt hatred for strong women especially women of color is not he supposed to be grieving for his brother he obsesses over the obamas he will never measure up to any former presidents even the very bad ones and i thought it could not get any more disgusting than nixon someone slap a straight jacket and handcuffs on the orange menace already he is worse than the pandemic he just plain hates and is intimidated by strong intelligent women does he do anything besides mock people someone is running scared so they run their mouth and vomit all over the country he gets more stupid by the day we have her back but as you all know he cannot touch her i am sorry as a supposedly grown man that you are still a childish bully it really tells you alot when they have top republicans speaking at the democratic convention why in the h do people think this is acceptable behavior from a president so tired of this repetitious whining and lying and demeaning of women just go away january 20th far far away i would pay a shitload of money to watch a debate between michelle and melania i want a decent person as potus not someone who committed treason to be placed in the office in the first place he should be disqualified to run again and the mud slinging continues it is really sad when the negative comments are all you have got he makes fun of everyone only thing he knows how to do certainly cannot lead intelligently can this man not do anything besides name calling i agree he is no role model for children we can tell that by his own children,"['people', 'trump', 'wife',

doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself.,"And Joe Biden sent condolences...if it were the other way around tRump would not have said a word!. Cherie Colbert Garcelon LOL! That's right!. Gerry Karagrozia so  glad  you  got  the  sarcasm  and  didn‚Äôt  start  yelling  at  me. Victoria Vacher oh yes, trump might have said something mean, he can‚Äôt restrain himself from being mean.. Victoria Vacher class, it's called class. Victoria Vacher he‚Äôd have been too busy playing golf.  Cheating on every stroke demands his complete attention.. Victoria Vacher exactly. Victoria Vacher no he wouldn‚Äôt have, but we have to be better than trump. Victoria Vacher truth. Victoria Vacher so true. Victoria Vacher absolutely true.. Victoria Vacher your right not a word. Ernesto Amaya if it were the other way around, Trump would have made it about himself. He can't help but be that way.. You are correct ,..look how the little cry baby treated John Lewis‚Äôs death !. Yvonne Jimenez Kelly yup low class. Victoria Vacher  the  Other way around Trump would have said a nother good Democrat( Remember he said the only good Democrat was a dead one). Victoria Vacher what is new he (#45) only cares about himself. Victoria Vacher exactly. Victoria Vacher probably true but saying the words does mean shit.. Victoria Vacher  You got that right!. Victoria Vacher you are full of B's and liberal hate you should seek help. Barb Nowitzke the fact that you find this funny proves my point... Yer low class!!. Victoria Vacher. Victoria Vacher yes!  tRump would have probably said something derogatory (per his history of this degrading mentality) about his personality or past  hoping to make himself look better.. Victoria Vacher , that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt give a damn. I have no sympathy or compassion.. Victoria Vacher very true. Victoria Vacher Biden shows class. DumF is just an ass. Victoria Vacher Absolutely true!. Victoria Vacher shows that human beings have compassion unlike.... Victoria Vacher I agree with you. Biden knows respect and dignity.  He is able to feel empathy.  He is what we are needing.. Victoria Vacher SO TRUE. No empathy or compassion, even for his own family.. Mary HG nothing, he not human he is the devil. Mary HG   Went to the movies when his older brother Freddie passed away.. Anti-Christ. what a piece of crap.  Doesn't even care about his own family.  Only cares about himself.  Even before the country he was sworn to defend.. Condolences to the family. Who may have told the COVID denier that his in and out trip to NY was reported and he can't come back unless he quarantines for 14 days (and masks).just like all citizens who have ill relatives.. so sad for this family!  Cold and evil, one shouldn't be surprised as to what trump, donnie j is.  An empty soul!!  And the saga goes on!!!  I think Mary Trump tried to stop it!. It's so obvious....he cares for no one, no one... not even family... only himself.  That's why he hasn't and never can do anything of value for this country. His only focus is on himself, and those who support him are abetting the destruction of our country.. I thought he said they were close,that his brother was his best friend.. one day that our Criminal President will be behind bars for the rest of his crappy life...and including his family and cabinet members as well.... Bring civility back to the US, it is a great country but it is running into disrepute under this man. He is to the US what King Herod was to babysitting!!!!. Trump is a malignant narcissist. They cannot feel empathy, and see people, everyone as objects to be used  in their favor. Sure, Trump loved his brother as anyone loves a brand new computer or car. When it goes defective... Trump loves no one. Not even himself. His inability to feel love is the root of his personality disorder.. Joe Biden should showed he can put politics aside in a time of family. Joe Biden is a bigger man he put politics aside and did the right thing and sent condolences to Trmup for he's  brothers death.. .....which makes one cringe that his avid supporters have the same mindset. A scary proposition of non-caring and unintelligent.. Sounds like Donald. All about himself.. That should tell his children something.. He said he was his best friend he really doesn‚Äôt care about anybody but himself. Nobody is as important as he thinks he is!! He doesn't has no empathy or sympathy.. No one should be surprised....he's right out there, showing the world who and what he is, a VILE individual, less than VERMIN!!!!!. He's a sociopath he didn't care about his brother and he sure as hell doesn't care about America or the American people.. R I P , Robert Trump, I don't know you ,but I probably care more than your brother ,who went to the movies and played golf what a  disgrace he is. Oh but ... Him being there instead of on the golf course wasn't as important as being on the golf course costing the taxpayers more money. The man is focused only on himself!  Completely incapable of thinking of anyone else!  No compassion, no feelings, nothing!  He never disappoints with his low life behaviors!!ü§¨üí©ü§Æü§¨üí©ü§Æ. trump is a hollow shell. He has no feelings except for hate, lust and greed. Isn't it good to know that personal tragedy does NOT get in the way of his other pursuits?  What a sleaze!!! üëπ. He was afraid that he would get stuck with the funnersl bill. Nothing is surprising regarding this narcissistic sociopath with no conscience or decency. Good night and good luck. Vote Blue  for  two great people of character and kindness, and don‚Äôt forget competence.. If that's how he treated the death of his brothers, why do we think it would affect him in any way when almost 170,000 Americans died. NOT HIS RELATIVES OR RICH FRIENDS!!!!!!!. A very lonely,very ill, individual,who should be removed from positions and places so not to endanger himself and others!!. He did visit him. Donald Trump visited Robert in the hospital just one day before his death. Trump paid a visit to his ailing brother, Robert, on Aug. 14. The POTUS Wannabe was at Manhattan‚Äôs New York-Presbyterian Hospital for less than an hour that Fr‚Ä¶See More. Golf is his Best friend  any human caring person would never leave the hospital if a family member or close friend were dying. What he cares about...... Nothing  about  this  man  surprises  me  anymore.    He is  completely   devoid of  normal  human  feelings.. When I heard that his brother and best friend had died, I checked the news. Nope! Putin‚Äôs still alive.. Sitting at the bedside and offering comfort to your family vs flying off to private resort and playing golf. Priorities are a choice.. Golf,golf,golf. He‚Äôs working sooo hard. What‚Äôs that costing the taxpayers? Get him out, and take away his money. So then he can play on Public Courses.. Out playing golf with a has been football player, that personally I‚Äôve never heard of, while his brother and best friend is in hospital dying??  That is one heartless Mother!!  ü§Ø. Surprised anyone?   I thought maybe it would slow him down but he has to compete with the Dem convention and make sure he steals the show somehow.   In Mary's book, you see what a rotten, lousy son, brother, friend, whatever, he really is.   What decent person goes golfing when his brother dies?. I cannot imagine my best friend or brother with me close by choosing to golf or go to a movie instead of being there for them as they go through this scary transition. It really defies normal means of behavior.. And cause of death unknown. Bet it's Covid and Trump will make sure it will never be revealed as such. It would make him look bad if his lack of action killed a family member.. So sad to be emotionally alone....no matter how many people are around him he is just in this little   bubble of solitude....kind of like a padded room .... No surprise, he‚Äôs an evil monster!. He does not have a single redeeming quality. He is a monster.. Shhh??? He was working hard to spend our hard earned dollars. His hip swing is very important than his dying brother!. I‚Äôm not excited about his brother‚Äôs death.I will be very excited if it‚Äôs the other way around.He said they will see each other again,I wish it will be soonü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. This guy has no soul.. I guess I will play golf when they announce Trump's death: and none too soon!. Melania‚Äôs coat Comes to mind . I don‚Äôt really care, do you? Not my thought! But that coat and what the hell inspires one to design it. Not to mention wearing it!. So much for his best friend!. Look at the glee on this evil orange gargoyle... Ugh! ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. Look up qualities of a narcissist: LACKS EMPATHY is one.. If he doesn‚Äôt care about his brother‚Äôs dead, why would he care about the 170,000 Americans lost to the COVID-19.

blind eye to his meddling in elections. As well as paying senate republicans for their cooperation..ie Russians built a plant in McConnell back yard...little insensitive like that to follow the leader. Kathleen Fils well stated. Someone said, a very long time ago I must add, that every time you see Trump do something that seems totally nuts, does not make sense, is not to the benefit of the US, whatever, stop and ask yourself one question -- how does this help Russia?  If it does in fact provide a benefit to Russia, then everything you thought Trump did that was crazy suddenly makes perfect sense.. Dana Ferraro üëç. What is even more sickening is the people who support him really and truly do not care and they will still vote for him....He is a God in their eyes.. Of course he knew about Everyone in government knew.We need to save our country from all the currupt government.We have to bring back our beautiful country back again.That is why we have to vote for Joe Biden. and Kamala Harris, to save our country.God Bless America.. A good amount of trumps wealth comes from Russia, and that was before the election. He has too much to personally lose if he stands up to Putin, so he never does. Such a wimp.. Being swept under the rug  just like all his criminal actions all his life.. a president is informed of every little thing in the world! he knew!and let it happen.for the sake of America,stand up to the con/murderer of Americans/chicken sh** of a man and under-educated wanna-be dictator!. This should be alarming to all Republicans!  Trump works for Putin and loves to play dumb.  If you vote for trump,  you will be living in  communist Russia next year! üíô üíô. Everyone else knew too and they are just as guilty as he is. They are so afraid of losing their well paying jobs and their high rank positions and all the perks that comes with it that they sit back in silence and say nothing. We already know that he c‚Ä¶See More. Just like Covid 19Decapatare him?Stonehim?‚Ä¶See More. Doesn‚Äôt matter his base doesn‚Äôt care about that even though he had a lot of people killed. He knows 1000/day are dying from Covid, and he sold PPE to Russia.Posimpotusputinoffice. He‚Äôs not concerned he‚Äôs trying to get re elected. So him and his family of grifters can continue to rape the tax payers and Trash our medical insurance and social services. I wouldn't be surprised if he's getting a kickback on each bounty. That would explain a lot, and be right in character for this heartless conman.. And the entire GOP, in all of their 'ball less' glory elected to ignore it as well.   I guess if it had been a sleeveless dress on FLOTUS Michelle, or POTUS Obama did this, the Senate would have been all over it.  The BIG FLUSH is coming on Nov. 3rd.........Eliminate them all and let's start over with uncorrupted replacements who are actually patriots.. Except numerous US intell agencies,British intell, Israeli intell and at least 2 members of Taliban along with a member of his administration have proven otherwise.. He truly doesn‚Äôt care.  Thank you for your services even under these circumstances.. And yet the GOP Senate is not demanding answers. Why?  We should all responsible for it. Our troops are not COLLATERAL DAMAGE.. Of course he knew and his traitorous acts against our military members should not go unpunished.. If a democrat President let this happen do you suppose republicans would still ignore it the way they have?. And that would surprise us....why? It‚Äôs typical Trump. Expect the worst from him and he will never let you down. If anything, he‚Äôll astound you with how low he can sink.. This is sickening!! I pray everyday that our sons and daughters are kept out of harms way !! Vote Blue üò°üá∫üá∏. Wait for malaria to get her I really don‚Äôt care coat because neither of them do. He's been a traitor since before he was president, common knowledge...OK now everyone mentally abuse me like normal do you all feel better.... I could not agree more.  Even if Trump himself ignores or does not read his Intelligence Briefings, somebody, somewhere in the chain would have brought his attention to this.  It is too whopping big for the president not to be told, and there are in pe‚Ä¶See More. Of course he knew but just doesn't care for anyone but himself. Blood on tRump's hands and he should be in prison.. Shame on all the cowardly republicans allowing Trump to sell out the U.S. to Russia üò° How dare they call themselves Americans !. The fear of Putin and greed of his payment is far larger than his feelings for Americans.. I ALMOST DID NOT CLICK ON THIS VBECAUSE I KNEW THE ANSWER, YES HE DID KNOW AND HE IS HAVING POMPEO MEET WITH THE RUSSIANS TRUMP HAD IN THE OVAL OFFICE AFTER THE ELECTION FOLKS JUST DAYS AFTER HE HAD THESE MURDEROUS RUSSIANS IN OUR OVAL OFFICE, WELL YOU KNOW MELANIA AND HER FAMILY ARE COMMUNISTS SO I GUESS RTHEY MAY HAVE COME TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS COMMUISTS WIFE.. I flat out say this bullshit. Everyone around him knew about it. He was afraid to bring it up to Putin. What a joke. Of course he knows.  The question is what did he get for keeping quiet????. He‚Äôs participating with Putin in the murdering of American soldiers.. We also know that Putin has something dangerously threatening (quite likely treasonous), hanging over Donnie's head, which is why he's so kiss-butt to everything Russian.. We know, for sure, that Trump knew over a month ago. That‚Äôs when he denied knowing sooner. Over a month, and he still has not criticized Russia/Putin for doing it, nor has he come up with a plan to stop it. Despicable!!!. So the so called patriots for Trump don't care. That says a lot about them as well. Shouldn't traitors be subject to death?. How do military veterans support this excuse of a human being???. Why isn't  that enough  for people to vote against  this traitor. The question that both Democrats and Republicans should be asking Trump is ‚Äúnow that you do know (even though there‚Äôs proof he did indeed know), what are you going to do about it?‚Äù ü¶ó ü¶ó.. Of course he knew, Barr said they talked about it!. He sold his soul to Putin to cover his debts. Plus, do you really think he reads his briefings binder?. He knew and did nothing about it. He is afraid of Putin and won't confront him about anything.. He needs to be hounded into an early grave.. If you people who believe this is true and  do nothing  your are guilty as Trump. Well well....he signed policy decisions and then has said...‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know anything about it‚Äùü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò°. Please vote Blue ,please vote Blue, try to save our country..

He knows and denies and does nothing about almost everything.... Putin owns Donald. The Steele dossier is all true.. And so does Moscow Mitch!!!!!. Russia has too much on him.  He's not going to go against Putin. Traitor in the WH.  Military should vote blue if they want to save their lives.. In 1980, the US military knew that President Carter was a pacifist  and wouldn't launch a retaliatory strike if the Soviets attacked.   They just hoped the Soviets wouldn't find out..

SUPPRESSION, and OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, and his repubes sit there with their nose up his ass ! ! !. Charles Pingel well said. .....OK COMRADE CHARLES!. Voter Suppression is the handlers of #45‚Äôs strategy to deflect our fear and concerns about his poor handling of the raging Covid pandemic ‚ÄòIt is what it is‚Äô #45‚Äôs response to Covid‚ò†Ô∏èWhen #45 attacks anything in a massive way, it‚Äôs always a ‚Äòsmoke & mirrors‚Äô deflection from a truth, this one being 170,000 deaths in the US as of today from the pandemic‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ÄòIt is What it is‚Äô. ABSOLUTELY  TRUE...WHILE THOUSANDS  OF AMERICANS  ARE DYING..ABSOLUTELY  CRIMINAL  BEHAVIOR... He is a disgrace to America !!! Taking over everything around us    No good Dictator!!!. Makes sense given he has no compassion or empathy for others while at the same time knowing probably prison time is waiting for him.. Jim Wazelle they provided the required ID when they registered. Getting a ‚Äúproper‚Äù Id today is not always easy, or possible, for many. Poor people can‚Äôt afford all the fees involved, and in some cases, outright impossible due to regulations that were i‚Ä¶See More. For Trump the Coronavirus, the permanent damage it causes or the deaths are just collateral damage.  I don't believe he cares at all.. Yes, he does not want people to vote. Smaller the number of people vote, he thinks better for him.. Trumptwat is destroying our democracy.  Only he would be so self serving and evil to destroy the post office for his own self interest.. The house the senate the federal courts the us barr the supreme court does nothing while trump continues to destroy America, what a shame!. He needs to be tried for treason when he leave office, just like the Nuremberg trials or Saddam Hussein for trying to strip our country of democracy and walking all over the Constitution!. Isn't that the horrible truth??!. Absolutely üíØ He doesn't care about any of us... Trump  has infringed  more  on  the second  amendment  than  Obama  ever  did  and  now  he‚Äôs  done  it  to  the  first  amendment  with  the  attacks  on  peaceful  protesters.  Now he‚Äôs  flat  out  attacking  democracy  by  trying to  deny  the  right  to  vote  or  the  ability of  millions of  Americans  to  cast  their  votes.. It is amazing to me how so many righteous people support Trump and his lying, cheating , felonious and misogynistic behavior?. Suppressing the vote has forever been a Republican tactic, but Trump has made it a slap in the face with the Post Office obliteration.. He is hoping the virus will keep people from going to the polls to vote. By stopping the mail-in vote he thinks he will win the election rigged once again. And you are more concerned about politics and should be back in your HOME town helping with all of its problems. Very true.  What gets me is he is either arrogant or stupid for revealing his plan.. Indeed! After all he is only doing what he is capable of doing that is NOTHING!. YES YOU ARE THE  ABSOLUTE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  DONNIE BOY. More people vote less chance of Donald president of Death winning. tRUMP is so stupid, maybe someone in his inner circle should have warn him that even if he won the election fair n square more then half of the population won't  believe it, and then things could become explosive in the usa. Yes he will be glad to serve second term in life prision. Why?  Because he was Black?  You are beyond oblivious to what is going on now and who is leading it.. I agree with you Bob. Now he trying everything he can do is to steal the election. The man is dishonest.. Donald's brother died two days ago. Donald say a thing until we exploded about USPS. He's trying to play the pity card.. Anyone who supports this baboon is a traitor just like trump,. So true, how come no one interferes? This shows once again none of the GOP, besides Mitt Romney, has a backbone and afraid of this traitor. I think it's the Democrats that are trying to rig things.. Ron is right - and DT is already trying to set up the argument that the election was rigged & so he can have a case to try to void it...Trump will be out ‚Äúby a landslide‚Äù but will try anything to keep the Presidency - brace up Americans, Trump‚Äôs most blatant ‚Äòscoffing of the law‚Äô could be just around the corner.... Dam right. He all over suppressing the vote but the Corona virus that will magically go away.. 100 times better than the POS in office right now.. Trump has failed like most of his adventures in business will you can mark this one as will. Failed. Or buildings or statues!! Both more important than American lives!!. So what is being done about it?. Obama went down in history as one of the best pres ever! Trump is the worst!Can't change history!. Obummer was the absolute worst thing to ever happen!.  ....HUSSAIN...You Get To STFU!!!.

nose up his ass charles pingel well said ok comrade charles voter suppression is the handlers of 45s strategy to deflect our fear and concerns about his poor handling of the raging covid pandemic it is what it is 45s response to covidwhen 45 attacks anything in a massive way it is always a smoke mirrors deflection from a truth this one being 170 000 deaths in the us as of today from the pandemic it is what it is absolutely true while thousands of americans are dying absolutely criminal behavior he is a disgrace to america taking over everything around us no good dictator makes sense given he has no compassion or empathy for others while at the same time knowing probably prison time is waiting for him jim wazelle they provided the required id when they registered getting a proper id today is not always easy or possible for many poor people cannot afford all the fees involved and in some cases outright impossible due to regulations that were for trump the coronavirus the permanent damage it causes or the deaths are just collateral damage i do not believe he cares at all yes he does not want people to vote smaller the number of people vote he thinks better for him trumptwat is destroying our democracy only he would be so self serving and evil to destroy the post office for his own self interest the house the senate the federal courts the us barr the supreme court does nothing while trump continues to destroy america what a shame he needs to be tried for treason when he leave office just like the nuremberg trials or saddam hussein for trying to strip our country of democracy and walking all over the constitution is not that the horrible truth absolutely he does not care about any of us trump has infringed more on the second amendment than obama ever did and now he is done it to the first amendment with the attacks on peaceful protesters now he is flat out attacking democracy by trying to deny the right to vote or the ability of millions of americans to cast their votes it is amazing to me how so many righteous people support trump and his lying cheating felonious and misogynistic behavior suppressing the vote has forever been a republican tactic but trump has made it a slap in the face with the post office obliteration he is hoping the virus will keep people from going to the polls to vote by stopping the mail in vote he thinks he will win the election rigged once again and you are more concerned about politics and should be back in your home town helping with all of its problems very true what gets me is he is either arrogant or stupid for revealing his plan indeed after all he is only doing what he is capable of doing that is nothing yes you are the absolute worst thing to happen to the united states of america donnie boy more people vote less chance of donald president of death winning trump is so stupid maybe someone in his inner circle should have warn him that even if he won the election fair n square more then half of the population will not believe it and then things could become explosive in the usa yes he will be glad to serve second term in life prision why because he was black you are beyond oblivious to what is going on now and who is leading it i agree with you bob now he trying everything he can do is to steal the election the man is dishonest donalds brother died two days ago donald say a thing until we exploded about usps he is trying to play the pity card anyone who supports this baboon is a traitor just like trump so true how come no one interferes this shows once again none of the gop besides mitt romney has a backbone and afraid of this traitor i think it is the democrats that are trying to rig things ron is right and dt is already trying to set up the argument that the election was rigged so he can have a case to try to void it trump will be out by a landslide but will try anything to keep the presidency brace up americans trumps most blatant scoffing of the law could be just around the corner dam right he all over suppressing the vote but the corona virus that will magically go away 100 times better than the pos in office right now trump has failed like most of his adventures in business will you can mark this one as will failed or buildings or statues both more important than american lives so what is being done about it obama went down in history as one of the best pres ever trump is the worst cannot change history obummer was the absolute worst thing to ever happen hussain you get to stfu this should infuriate everyone ,"['trump', 'right', 'people',

He's EXACTLY what America need to TAKE this Country BACK from the TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. Get ALL those Republicans OUT.. Postal workers should donate some time to count votes and make sure ballots are delivered.To save their job from this tyrant. God help us if he is reelected.. trump is taking money out of the postal workers pockets to try to protect him to be re-elected!  It is sad that some Americans cannot see or want to see through his con!  It effects everyone and not just democrats!. Yes Union Strong. Support your postal workers Everyone get out and Vote Blue for Biden and Harris. okay so what say us former postal employees volunteer to count votes just for this election.. That would be GREAT,I'm sure my wife would agree,before Cheetos man fks up and steals all your retirement money,and INSURANCE. There you go a simple way to make the man in the WH go cuckoo. Next is the Republicans in the senate who block the stimulus bill let them go down in defeat this November. As of the house maintain the status quo but get rid of Congressional Republican terrorists.. Its on hold supposedly till after the election. Terrible. I made the call to the senators . Callüìû‚òéÔ∏è. Many years ago during a mail strike in New York the National Guard was called out to sort the mail!  Is it the Governors who get to call them up? If so let them call up the guard to sort and count the votes!. Joe biden's incapable of being president, the Democrats won him in there so that they can tell him what to do, and then get rid of him.. Thank you Postal Workers! Vote early! Vote blue!!. I still say he only cares about HIMSELF ,greed is a ugly thing to have .. post office been open for a lot of years took baby hurt 3 years to file bankruptcy. Sounds like a plan but you can‚Äôt count what hasn‚Äôt been delivered because of no overtime or whatever.. Maybe this is a thank you trump, the last straw üòâ. The union also did not fail to note the postmaster general‚Äôs conflicts of interest and efforts to ‚Äúkneecap‚Äù the postal system, as President Obama referred to them. The Trump administration‚Äôs naked power grab will not go unnoticed by voters in November, either. From the article.. Doesn't the new head of the Postal Service have investments in other mail delivery companies?. Fauci says we can vote in person. Vote üó≥ Blue is the right thing to Do !. How about.  FedEx. They work too. They need help. I think it's great but its just going to piss off Trump more. He is a S##T show!!. Don‚Äôt piss off union workers!. He will turn on them. I can‚Äôt believe Trump is now removing post boxes in Montana. But Trump and his wife voted by mail in ballots last week. God I despise that man. People are pissed. He‚Äôs gotta go.. Oops Henry ended up blocked.....  How did that happen?. Great!. All unions should vote democrat, the only union trump cares about is the police union and that‚Äôs only because he backs the bad people in their union. Maybe they should look at themselves why trump backs them. Get movin joe. 2 1/2 months  how many more institutions will he try to destroy?. Buy stamps!. I guess that he'll just fire them all on Monday.. Go for it get trumps ass the hell out of the W H. Looks like the pressure got to the USPS. They put out a statement tonight........‚ÄúWe are suspending the removal of collection boxes at this time. All postings on collection boxes will be removed, as we will no longer be pulling any boxes. ‚Äú. So why do the Republican politicians let this go on? Because they ALL get a piece of the action. They ALL get Republican funds from Russia or other corrupt world organizations, funneled through the NRA and other corrupt donors. If they say something, they lose any s‚Ä¶See More. Do people actually think that just because the union backs Biden that all postal workers are going to vote for him if so I have a bridge and a island I want to sale.

We see that in North Indian languages like Hindi and Punjabi - all entities in the world are categorized as either masculine or feminine. Assamese, like Malayalam, has gendered pronouns. Languages like Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada have three categories like Sanskrit for masculine, feminine and neuter genders. Tamil has a unique concept of Thinai where entities are categorized as Uyarthinai and Ahrinai - (Rational and Irrational). Humans, Gods and Demons are Uyarthinai and rest everything is in Ahrinai. The first category has gender associated with it. The second category can be further classified as animate and inanimate (living and non-living) which have further specific word usage. Malayalam, the youngest Dravidian language has no gender in the verbs, however there are gendered pronouns. Telugu is interesting because technically it has the three genders, but in practical usage, there are 2 - masculine and non-masculine. Bengali, Odia, Assamese and most NE languages except for Khasi have no grammatical genders. Mundari languages do not have masculine and feminine differentiation (which is changing due to interaction to other gendered languages) but have a human-nonhuman gender difference.

The answer is not indentured laborers' greater productivity. Most planters were convinced that their indentured Indian laborers were less productive than the Africans they supplanted. Nor was indentured labor necessarily cheaper once the considerable recruitment costs were taken into consideration. The key factor may have been that the terms of the indentured contract allowed for much greater control of the labor force. - David Northrup,Duh.

Following a strike of banana workers in 1928 which was violently crushed that December, Cano was jailed for conspiracy, despite not having been present.

Amidst a wave of strikes of mostly male transport and dockworkers across Britain, a group of mostly non-union women and girls working in factories walked out and began parading through the streets, calling on other workers to join them. Custard, jam, biscuit, tool and tent-making factories were among those shut down, with around 14,000 women from ov...er 20 different employers on strike within a few days. Employers complained of a ""reign of terror"" by the workers, and the government responded by ordering troops to be stationed in nearby Southwark Park. The strikers got assistance from the National Federation of Women Workers, who raised money and helped the women formulate concrete demands to make of employers. Companies rapidly began to cave in, abolishing piecework and increasing pay in most of the struck enterprises over the next month. While many male unionists had dismissed women workers, like Labour MP and union leader Will Thorne who claimed that women ""do not make good trade unionists"", thousands of women joined unions during the dispute and organised themselves. * We have lots of interesting anniversaries today: for all of them follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/wrkclasshistory","It could be done today, but so many have become brain-washed by the media..

The Federation of South African Women-organised demonstration delivered a petition against the laws with 100,000 signatures and the participants sang ""Wathint‚ÄôAbafazi Wathint‚Äôimbokodo"" meaning ‚ÄòNow you have touched the women, you have struck a rock‚Äô. The protest kickstarted a wave of civil disobedience across the country over two years in which thousands of women were arrested, until African National Congress leaders panicked and called it off.

A former nurse in the anarchist Iron Column militia, she was arrested in 1939 charged with various offences, mostly committed while she was in hospital after being shot during the civil war. Despite three years of imprisonment, beatings and torture, she refused to admit anything but tragically was executed anyway. A public square is named after her, and she has been the subject of two books and a play.

edits to this graphic for clarity. Hopefully it's more clear than the previous version. #LearnSocialism Image description: The Purchase of People Under capitalism, capitalists purchase amounts of labor from wage-workers. The amount of labor purchased is measured in units of time, usually by the hour. When labor is purchased in units of time, it becomes a special commodity (a good or service) called labor-power. This exchange between capitalists (employers) and wage-workers (employees) creates an illusion: that a worker is even capable of selling their labor or their time separate from themselves in the first place. Hidden behind this illusion is a truth: that a person's labor and time are, in reality, inseparable from their person. [Pictogram: A triangle, with a person at the top corner, a hand holding a wrench (representing labor) at the bottom right corner, and a hand holding a clock (representing time) at the bottom left corner.] This means that with the sale of human labor-power comes the purchase of not only people's labor and time, but also of people. The basic difference between the slave and the wage-worker is this: the slave is sold by another all at once and as a whole, while the wage-worker must sell themselves to one capitalist or another, again and again, hour by hour, piece by piece.","+- 12 hours somewhere. +- 12 hours somewhere.

Many governments have refused to enact total quarantines, and those who have, have established all sorts of tricks to ensure the normal functioning of trade and production, forcing us to risk dying from COVID-19, whether through work or hunger, without income... or economic protection to face this crisis and provide for our families. Likewise, we have witnessed the epic image that has been built around health workers, who are really risking their lives to save others, without adequate protection, sufficient personnel, and the equipment necessary to truly combat the pandemic. What they call heroism is precarity; appealing to heroic applause for those who should be able to serve safely. With horror we see how the police and repressive forces that circulate through the streets implementing control over people have these security elements financed by public spending. In other words, the priority is repression and control of the population, instead of taking care of and providing the essentials for life. The working class has to participate in decision-making about this crisis, about who will pay for it, about what measures will be taken in the territories to deal with it, we cannot simply be spectators at this juncture. In turn, the call is to take care of ourselves, to unite in these times of estrangement, to express more solidarity and not let go. Only solidarity and mutual aid will allow us to resist.

are generally not socialists in any ideological sense or really any other sense of the word they are capitalist social democrats anarchy is cool and all but we also have an imploding imperial power to fight that is trying to take out everyone else with it and you kinda need a strong state to defend against that for the time being aj davis we recommend reading this piece by a historian of anarchism not clicking that crap but seriously we need to learn how to teach portions of our country and culture how to give a damn about people about society to stop fetishizing this kind of radical independence where it is okay to say fuck everyone else because i got mine let me argue on social media and do nothing else while waiting for the perfect social movement after all of the correct books are read to participate the pandemic did not turn people into socialists capitalism did did not need a pandemic to make me socialist that boat sailed 3 years ago i was already an anarchist where do i go from here do i go full circle and start republican i get the sentiment but it is obviously democratic socialism that millennials are leaning towards oddly i am seeing a revival of leninism with the read lenin gen z and even some circles that are reviving maoism it is kinda heart warming to see moms in the er beaten bruised sporting black bandanas around their necks not heartwarming to see the beaten bruised part obviously but it does make me feel like saluting them for their battle wounds people are already socialist they just do not know it the countries that have succeeded the best at dealing with this have been often left wing but are socialist with communist parties black rose seriously needs to get their shit together and read the articles before they post them why are you sharing from bloomberg anyway come on black rose you all did not even have a snappy caption to combat the conclusion of the article which was just more liberal bullshit yeah socialist to anarchist is a step backwards sorry john hedlund we recommend giving this piece a read the author is completing their phd on the history and strategy of north american and european anarchism many of us have been anarchists all along please just stop with the fake generation gap bullshit maybe just make the headline a text post and dont link the article because i want to heart react it still ironic to see this is a bloomberg article anarchy is humanitys natural tendency lol what a crock of shit this article is guillotine 2020 we can hope i was socialist pre covid now i am dead set on abolishing the whole government as we know it bloomberg this is a right wing article this is what they are politically advocating the better path for policymakers across the west is to offer more pragmatic but still sufficiently bold alternatives and as i have argued this means reviving christopher clark we are not sharing the article for the content it is crap just making a joke on the title it would be tragic if we survived the pandemic only to find ourselves living in true socialism which in practice has always robbed societies of prosperity and individuals of freedom robbed societies of prosperity and individuals of freedom nick anderson we are not sharing the article for the content it is crap just making a joke on the title lmao good luck on that better offer you fucking conjobbers as anarchists you know damn well social democrats are not socialist there f ing liberals who like welfare and they only identify as socialist because their glenn beck sounding parents you might not like us mls all that much but come on do not sell out that hard whether millennials actually use the word socialism properly as government ownership of the means of production is moot um i am pretty sure that is communism not socalisim socalisim is worker owned fuck that boomer bullshit it would be tragic if we survived the pandemic only to find ourselves living in true socialism which in practice has always robbed societies of prosperity and individuals of freedom to avoid that fate all generations should offer millennials a fairer a liberal deal lol ok,"['socialist', 'article', 'read', 'socialism',

It would take every bit of political capital the Democrats have built over the last three years, and the only real-world effect would be that you can buy the gun on top, but not the gun below. The basic function of a rifle -- sending a bullet out of a barrel -- is what makes it deadly. Any legislation restricting the features on a rifle will lead to the production of loophole guns that are equally powe...rful but manage to avoid the ""assault weapon"" category. This isn't even getting into the fact that there are *at least* 5-10 million fully-featured AR-15s already in circulation in the United States. So even if a ban were to pass, it would be functionally irrelevant. Image Description: An image displaying two AR-15 platform rifles that are almost exactly the same, save for three small differences. One rifle is labeled ‚ÄúNot an Assault Rifle At All‚Äù, the other is labeled ‚ÄúDefinitely an Assault Rifle‚Äù. At the bottom, an SRA logo and text that reads: ‚ÄúThe Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 did not reduce the availability of rifles in the US, nor did it make them any less lethal. In function, the law created an environment where manufacturers produced the same firearms with slightly different features, while artificially inflating the value of pre-ban models.‚Äù","One slight problem. There is a difference between assault rifles and assault weapons. An assault rifle is a select fire shoulder weapon chambered in an intermediate cartridge and was already regulated by the NFA as a machine gun before they were even invented. An assault weapon is whatever the fuck liberals in New York and California want to call it in order to make sure citizens can't have good guns.. Putting your focus on arguing semantics vs broadly accepted nomenclature is not going to help anything,. Randall Munro broadly accepted doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs correct.. Randall Munro except that's not semantics. that's literal legal definition of an assualt rifle. and assualt weapon can literally be anything someone deems scarey. theres no legal definition for it at all. Being incorrect on legal technicalities doesn't help our image much either. Don't act like no reactionary will ever see it, pick it apart, and tell everyone we don't know what we're doing. An assault rifle has an automatic selector switch. It is already banned. That an overlooked technicality here üòÜ. Marie Cassandra Tristani Trust me you guys are already way ahead of all the people on the pseudo-socialists page(Democratic socialists) lol that place is a fucking joke.. Assault rifles aren't a real thing. Assault rifle is a select fire (implying modes other then semi auto such as full or burst fire) chambered in an intermediate cartridge.  A semi auto rifle is a semi auto rifle no matter if the barrel is threaded, or if there is a bayonet lug or if the magazine is large or small.End of.. Support the 2nd amendment, but remember support single action long guns not semi auto long guns. Support bolt action, lever action, and pump action long guns.

Peter RaymondCheck out a podcast called It Could Happen Here. There's an episode detailing how a rebellion could succeed in America.. Peter Raymond your ego is showing bud. You are obviously not familiar with military tactics or revolutionary action. Your argument is valid and has been noted, but history does not align with what you are saying. Revolutionary actions take time and build up from grassroot action.. bruh.... Peter keeps calling everyone morons which is incredibly ironic.. Imagine thinking the 2nd Amendment was about hunting. Lol. You know what the only distance between a semiautomatic rifle and a pistol is? Effective range and rifles require two hands to shoot and can't be concealed. That's it. Both are equally deadly. Just because you are afraid of the word semiautomatic doesn't mean it's an assault weapon. Pistols are semiautomatic too. Are you gonna ban them too?. Jonathan McCowan the IRA brought no-one to a standstill, the (now threatened due to Brexit!) Good Friday Agreement happened because enough ordinary people from both sides of the divide & the political orgs had seen enough bloodshed from terrorists & the sometimes murderous British army.

Bruce Andrew Hansen support the 1st amendment.  But remember only support non-auto refill pens or electronic communications.  Support quill and ink on paper only.  Do not support widespread automatic communications.. Broose Andrew Hansen I don‚Äôt believe the 2cnd amendment has any type of wording banning any type of weapon ... sorry. Peter, that‚Äôs an argument for citizens to have more strong and powerful weapons, not less of them.  I do believe the government would bomb its own people but if they plan on winning, they‚Äôll still need the infrastructure to maintain some semblance of sanity among those that didn‚Äôt rise up..

Dont ban the gun then, ban the ammunition. Make it so you can only buy ammunition at licensed target ranges, and you're not allowed to take the ammunition home.. Any weapon not capable of selective fire is ipso facto NOT an assault rifle lacking one of the defining features of the category..

This is what a legal AR-15 looks like with an ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù ban.  Still shoots the same, just less comfortable to hold.. No such thing, Full Auto, semi-auto or single fire. The suppressor ban has somehow kept mass shooters loud though.. here you go Kevin Gilbert, these are the types I associate with. You forget the 3 round burst to fully auto. They wanna ban both. And confiscate all that are already out there.. Eric Knabe. Austin Rose. I'll take my 12ga with a 3.5"" in buck over these toys any day. This all assumes they'd call an assault rifle the same thing as the old ban.That said. I really don't see any particular weapon ban working when almost any other kind of firearm would be just as effective.‚Ä¶See More. That‚Äôs not true you can limit it to just single action rifles and not 30 round clips. Combat rifles like ARs aren‚Äôt the same as simple hunting rifles.. Roberto Acquafredda..

So my rifle will be worth more money?  Thanks dumbocrats!. The majority of the population supports banning them.

Forgets selective fire is the main definition of an assault rifle. 2019 assault weapons ban bill.https://www.congress.gov/.../116th.../senate-bill/66/text. Chris Brian Swientek confirm?.

and kalashnikov but no mention of the other major companies that produce far better job security for the undertaker take barrett arms even though it is a 50 cal anti material rifle producer just about all of their weapons would not be classified as assault weapons under the terms above amen as long as it fires rounds at indecent rate it is a good deterrent for would be attackers and hey if you guys are after some lighthearted good fun maaaaybe come like this page its run by some lefties and it is 100 worker friendly this is why i favor applying the machine gun act approach to everything that can hold more than 6 rounds the ma has been around for many decades and collectors reenactors can still get a bar or something if they want but nobodys been getting killed with them dont ban the gun then ban the ammunition make it so you can only buy ammunition at licensed target ranges and you are not allowed to take the ammunition home any weapon not capable of selective fire is ipso facto not an assault rifle lacking one of the defining features of the category do not forget the pistol grip makes it a lot more deadly if you live in ny bayonets are pretty cool though i like spears spears are good i did not know this before i saw this thanks for the education naw i do not agree with this large capacity magazine bans definitely save lives expect awb 2 0 to just ban semi automatic rifles and expect the next evolution of the ar pattern to allow you to cock it with your thumb or something like that this is what a legal ar 15 looks like with an assault weapons ban still shoots the same just less comfortable to hold no such thing full auto semi auto or single fire the suppressor ban has somehow kept mass shooters loud though here you go kevin gilbert these are the types i associate with you forget the 3 round burst to fully auto they wanna ban both and confiscate all that are already out there eric knabe austin rose i will take my 12ga with a 3 5 in buck over these toys any day this all assumes they would call an assault rifle the same thing as the old ban that said i really do not see any particular weapon ban working when almost any other kind of firearm would be just as effective that is not true you can limit it to just single action rifles and not 30 round clips combat rifles like ars are not the same as simple hunting rifles roberto acquafredda also pick up your shit while you still can extended mag bans almost always come first when did all these gun grabbers start following this page if it is such an issue to you then move to freaking canada where owning a firearm is not a constitutional right do not try to abolish that right here just because you think it is acceptable fixed this for you so my rifle will be worth more money thanks dumbocrats the majority of the population supports banning them left slanted polling shows about 75 the recent polling from fox news obviously right slanted shows 66 in favor of a new permanent awb i sort of assume but does anyone know if the 3 who own half of all guns 8 or more each person are mostly or all white supremacists forgets selective fire is the main definition of an assault rifle 2019 assault weapons ban bill chris brian swientek confirm it is an assault weapon built for 1 thing only kill lots of people very quickly the only difference between the civilian and military m16 is the switch to full automatic it is like letting anyone drive a semi truck or passenger bus without training dead schoolchildren the price we pay so some smalldicked boy can prance around playing scary army man enlist u

This reality illuminates the true role these agencies play; the militant arm of a violent settler-colonial project, responsible for targeting indigenous and other ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù populations as our liberal-democratic systems of governance decay into an increasingly reactionary, fa...scist form. In light of the recent news regarding plans for an ICE training facility with ‚Äúsimulations of homes in Chicago and Arizona,‚Äù that are so ‚Äúhyper-realistic‚Äù that they include details like ‚Äúdishes in the sink, toys in the yard,‚Äù it becomes clear that ICE is even further militarizing themselves to target communities at home. Rightly alarmed by these developments, more and more people have been asking how they can defend their communities from being torn apart by raids and other anti-immigrant ICE actions. One such tool is the Rapid Response Network. Rapid Response Networks can use a variety of tactics in response to ICE raids ‚Äî some send teams to provide legal council, some collect information so families‚Äô loved ones are not lost in the immigration system, some send volunteers with video equipment to film encounters. And when necessary, some will go as far as hosting targets of ICE in their very own homes. #WeKeepUsSafe Suggestions for Building a Rapid Response Network in your workplace: https://www.labornotes.org/‚Ä¶/building-rapid-response-networ‚Ä¶ Example of a Rapid Response Network organized by religious leaders in southern California: https://www.cnn.com/‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶/us/california-immigrant-safe-houses/","so a network of aiding and abetting criminals?  k..

Namely, the inherently exploitative nature of the capitalist mode of production. While Hampton and the BPP were committed Marxists, they did not take a class reductionist point of view. They incorpora...ted race not only in their materialist analysis, but also in their praxis. In 1968, Hampton helped organize the Rainbow Coalition, a multi-racial coalition of street gangs in Chicago, united behind the understanding that racial and ethnic conflict between gangs would only keep its members entrenched in poverty. Hampton was so effective in his work of uniting the proletariat, so threatening to the existing Capitalist economic order, that the FBI decided to murder him in bed, in the middle of the night, during a no-knock raid, as he slept next to his partner. The FBI organized a death squad. And they achieve their goal. Twenty-one years old. 21. The city of Chicago and the federal government ultimately had to pay $1.85 million to families of the deceased (the largest-ever civil rights settlement at the time) because the state‚Äôs actions were so egregious. It was an unspeakable loss for the countless people who knew and loved Hampton. But at the same time, as Hampton himself acknowledged: ‚ÄúYou can jail revolutionaries, but you can‚Äôt jail the revolution‚Ä¶ You might murder a freedom fighter‚Ä¶ but you can‚Äôt murder freedom fighting.‚Äù Image Description: Image of Fred Hampton with text: ""I ain't going to die in no airplane.

one step back comrades this bootlicker is gonna get a lot of cops killed ben crozier fuck those cops bootlicker any attempt to disarm the working class must be frustrated i really do not understand most liberals we cannot trust the police but the place should be the only ones with guns have to sell them to the government sounds much more palatable than the government is going to confiscate your guns good thing i have an sks and a mini 14 the big problem with dems that making it difficult to elect them is they continue to violate the 2nd amendment at will leading us directly into a nazi style police state where they have already made it clear who they will attack as they already do with near impunity i would be throwing away my own life by voting for democrats bruv you are from texas you know how that would turn out the hardware stores are gonna sell out of shovels and 55 gallon drums this is how you get a civil war i will bet that this would never happen if it did he would be expelled from office real quick he was also selling these lol he is a 2 to 3 percenter 2 to 3 percent of the polls ha what a shame i just lost my ar in a freak boating accident why cannot gun control be a non issue to dems it would be infinitely easier to justify voting for one dems should take obamas example and look for sensible ways to expand gun rights not restrict them there goes his texas votes lol if is doing a lot of work here oh damn i seem to have misplaced my rifle how does he plan to do this there is no national registry on long arms so how will they even know who has them i wonder if he plans to vilify my favorite rifle the sks well he wont sooo definitely a hitler like tactic and this coming from a democrat as if he will get elected my ak fell down a well sorry well i will sell mine for the low cost of 100k each if he thinks the fascists are violent now wait till he tries this there will be a bloodbath good thing he is not even close glad he is not going to be president oh you are still here no one will ever agree on what an assault rifle even is i guarantee he does not know proposals like this will never happen beta what about running over children with your car is that gonna be legal finally well lucky there are 20 other candidates to choose from lol that totally worked in new zealand swing and a miss this is where i wish i would have bought 80 lowers instead of ones that require a transfer do not trust the government but want the government to be the only ones to own guns i do not dislike beto but this is seriously a bad idea will our representatives still applaud the workers for refusing to sell to the government this is interesting how does one reconcile their love absolute necessity for the right to keep and bear arms and support of leftist politicians that want to strip them of those rights have not all of the democrat candidates expressed that they plan to take action against assault weapons he can piss off f him then this policy is simply impossible to enforce the government lies steals and kills unarmed people far more often than citizens do if anything we should be disarming the gov not citizens for how much ecause you gotta admit that after the government forces you to sell your guns they probably are not going to pay people what they are worth which just makes it theft i am not a socialist but i

Tackett said (their) organization is trying to fill gaps in relief efforts for poor, immigrant and other historically underserved communities, as they may not always receive the same resources or the same urgency from government or non-government agencies and organizations. ‚ÄòIt is not unheard of, unfortunately, that ICE agents and other federal and state authorities like to camp out in front of these distribution centers, especially those run by established organizations like the Red Cross,‚Äô Tackett said. ‚ÄòA big part of what the SRA is trying to do is being able to reach out to these underserved communities who have reason to be concerned about going to even like a Red Cross shelter which, even though that shelter itself might be set up with the best of intentions, it‚Äôs being used and exploited by those who have not good intentions.‚Äô The SRA‚Äôs fundraiser page can be found at MightyCause.com/story/1h9hsf.‚Äù",I'm just baffled as to why some people dont notice the glaring similarities between the US government and that of the Third Reiche....Absolutely floored..

The SRA is fundraising for its disaster relief operations ahead of Hurricane Dorian's landfall on the Atlantic coast. With your help last year we raised $1300 for Hurricane Florence and $3500 for Hurricane Michael. This year we're asking for $5000 for an even larger relief effort under our new SRAid banner (which will be launching independently next year as its own 501(c)(3) charity!) Your donation will be used to purchase food, water, ...blankets, first aid, diapers, menstrual products, and other essential supplies. Our Southeast Disaster Relief Coordinator will stage near Gainesville, GA along with our volunteer members. Depending on when and where the storm makes landfall we will either deliver supplies to emergency shelters before the storm hits, or venture into the affected area after the storm has passed. In either case we will try to make sure our donations are made available to vulnerable and under-served populations that may not be able to rely on FEMA or the Red Cross for assistance. Any donations in excess of what we are able to put towards relief for Hurricane Dorian will be used in future disaster relief efforts, or will be put towards a generator and other improvements for our new disaster relief trailer. The SRA is dedicated to improving community resiliency in the face of climate change and its attendant natural disasters. The work we do for disaster relief today will help us build skills and organizational experience to defend our communities from any danger.  We protect us. We keep us safe.

One key element of the fightback is the community defense patrol, a rapid response tactic designed to quickly react to ICE activity. Following the ...recent mass workplace ICE raid in Mississippi, in which 680 people were arrested, the critical need for community education and rapid response to ICE is all the more evident. Although the specifics of the tactic may vary at different times, community defense patrolling involves groups of activists walking, biking or driving around specific locations where people endure high risk of being arrested by ICE. With the threat of ICE ever-present in immigrant communities, patrol participants organize to monitor areas where raids and arrests may happen. Their physical presence in vulnerable locales facilitates a rapid response to help defend people targeted by ICE.‚Äù","ACTUAL self-defense against a tyrannical government, which means this will get silence or condemnation from the NRA crowd.

Founded last year, the SRA says it aims to help members of the working class effectively defend themselves and their communities. 'Defense' is defined broadly: the group‚Äôs 52 chapters around the country have organized disaster relief e...fforts and litter clean-ups along with firearm safety classes and gun range days. The group exists in part to be a leftist alternative to the NRA, which Tackett considers a 'reactionary, capitalist institution.' The organization believes marginalized groups, including people of color and LGBTQ people, should have a space where they can learn how to use firearms to defend themselves. The group‚Äôs vice president, Faye Ecklar, a transgender socialist, says that it‚Äôs about creating 'a culture in which guns are a small part of a much larger revolutionary project to build communities that don‚Äôt need to rely on the state for protection.'""","Your Socialist ideology and private gun ownership are incompatible..

Developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov rifle (or ""AK"") family. Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945. In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. Even after seven decades, the model and i...ts variants remain one of the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of its reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region, and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual, crew-served and specialized firearms. As of 2004, ""Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s"".

There are a few things we can predict.  Despite public claims that they have no intention of dolling out violence on community members, the fascists have already shared all over their private profiles that this is exactly their mission. They will show up in body armor, shields, and armed with batons and other makeshift weapons. They will instigate v...iolence against local community members. And then, despite clear violent provocation from the far right, the police will side with the fascists and attack the Portland community that they supposedly defend. Tomorrow, liberal and conservative politicians and talking heads in the media will erroneously hand wring about ‚Äúviolence on both sides.‚Äù In short, we will see the utter ineffectiveness of the state‚Äôs response to the rising tide of white supremacy, and the necessity of a united, community response to fascist street organizing wherever it appears.

When you contextualize this murder with the Dayton shooter who killed his brother (a trans man who had recently begun to share their gender identity with trusted friends), and also with the Isla Vista shooting in 2014 carried out by an incel, you see that there is an unmistakable thread of misogyny running through these terror ...attacks. Sometimes it emerges in the form of patriarchal, hierarchy-obsessed fascism, as is the case with this Norwegian terrorist. Other times it emerges in the form of misogynistic incel culture, as is the case with the Dayton and Isla Vista shooters. Regardless of the particular ideological bent, it‚Äôs essential that we remain as steadfast and vigilant in our fight against misogyny and transphobia, as we do in our fight against racism and xenophobia. Lives depend on it. Also big ups to Mr. Rafiq. ‚ÄúA 65-year-old man who tackled a gunman who stormed a mosque in Norway is being hailed as a hero. The attacker, who was reportedly wearing a uniform and body armour, broke through a glass door to reach the place of worship, where people were preparing to celebrate the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha. A post on an online messaging board suggested (the shooter) was a far-right extremist inspired by the Christchurch, Poway and El Paso shooters. The same man is also accused of killing his 17-year-old stepsister, whose body was found at her home. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre investigating this as an attempt at carrying out an act of terrorism,‚Äô assistant chief of police Rune Skjold told a news conference on Sunday. ‚ÄòWe have uncovered extreme right-wing attitudes.

During his childhood and adolescence at school, Freire ended up four grades behind, and his social life revolved around playing pick-up football with other poor children, from whom he states to have learned a great deal. These experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire state...d that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: ""I didn't understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn't dumb. It wasn't lack of interest. My social condition didn't allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge"".

They knew what today‚Äôs well-meaning advocates of gun control do not ‚Äî that the black letter of the law is one thing and de facto power relations are quite another.  These gun control laws were passed to disarm black citizens. We might do well to keep this history in mind today when we consider how new, more restrictive gun laws will be applied. Were th...e mere dictates of positive law the panacea that mainstream progressives believe they are, the history of this country would have looked very different.  Today, gun control legislation aggravates the criminal justice crisis in the United States, having a disproportionate impact on black Americans... Some left-wing groups are beginning to understand this and respond accordingly, abandoning the irrational and baseless conventional wisdom that support of robust gun rights is somehow conservative. The Trigger Warning Queer & Trans Gun Club and the Socialist Rifle Association are just two of the growing number of politically left-wing gun clubs and affinity organizations popping up with the goal of arming and preparing vulnerable groups.  In principle, gun control is not a liberal or progressive cause, but an authoritarian, socially retrograde one that puts vulnerable groups in harm‚Äôs way. Favoring strong gun rights for every single individual is a radically left-wing stance if ever there was one, placing the vulnerable on level ground with would-be oppressors both inside of government and outside.‚Äù Join your local SRA chapter today: www.socialistra.org/membership","Yep.

In particular, 4chan and a few self-styled journalists have attempted to smear and defame the SRA. Some points of fact: The Dayton shooter was not and has never been a member of the SRA. His name does not appear in our member rolls, and he has never to our kno...wledge attended any event hosted by our chapters. 4chan has attempted to claim that a member of our Central Ohio chapter was the shooter, based on them both wearing horn rimmed glasses. The person they accused is alive and well, and also not the shooter. Some individuals have also tried to claim that the SRA is an ""antifa militia"". The SRA is not a militia; it is a firearms education and advocacy organization with affiliated local gun clubs.

Candidate after candidate repeated a list of proposals they would try to enact if they become president: universal background checks, a so-called assault weapons ban, restrictions on magazine capacity, and laws to prevent those with history of mental illness or domestic violence from buying guns. But researchers who study gun violence question how effective some of the Democrats' proposals would actually be if turned into law.‚Äù","Taking guns away only hurts marginalized communities and gun control laws have been inherently racist since their inception when African Americans started standing up to the clan and chasing them out their towns.

The text, which has been banned in multiple countries, essentially advocates for social Darwinism, or the idea that members of c...ertain races or ethnicities are inherently better equipped for survival than others. The author argues that true egalitarianism does not and cannot exist, and that the 'white race' is inherently biologically superior to other races.

The 26th of July Movement's name originated from the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks, an army facility in the city of Santiago de Cuba, on 26 July 1953. This attack was led by a young Fidel Castro, who was a legislative candidate in a free ...election that had been cancelled by Batista. The attack had been intended as a rallying cry for the revolution.  Castro was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison but, along with his group, was granted an amnesty after two years following a political campaign on their behalf. Castro travelled to Mexico to reorganize the movement in 1955 with several other exiled revolutionaries (including Ra√∫l Castro, Camilo Cienfuegos, and Juan Almeida Bosque). Their task was to form a disciplined guerrilla force to overthrow Batista. On 2 December 1956, 82 men landed in Cuba, having sailed in the boat Granma from Tuxpan, Veracruz, ready to organize and lead a revolution. The early signs were not good for the movement. They landed in daylight, were attacked by the Cuban Air Force, and suffered numerous casualties. The landing party was split into two and wandered lost for two days, most of their supplies abandoned where they landed. They were also betrayed by their peasant guide in an ambush, which killed more of those who had landed. Batista mistakenly announced Fidel Castro's death at this point. Of the 82 who sailed aboard the Granma, only 12 eventually regrouped in the Sierra Maestra mountain range.  While the revolutionaries were setting up camp in the mountains, ""Civic Resistance"" groups were formulating in the cities, putting pressure on the Batista regime. Many middle-class and professional persons flocked toward Castro and his movement. While in the Sierra Maestra mountains the guerrilla forces attracted hundreds of Cuban volunteers and won several battles against the Cuban Army.  Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was shot in the neck and chest during the fighting, but was not severely injured. (Guevara, who had studied medicine, continued to give first aid to other wounded guerrillas.) This was the opening phase of the war of the Cuban Revolution, which continued for the next two years. It ended in January 1959, after Batista fled Cuba for Dominican Republic, on New Year's Eve when the Movement's forces marched into Havana.
