"Alex Epstein, the author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, considers the details of the Green New Deal.","Kudos to all the commenters who came before me for pointing out exactly where Prager gets its funding from.  I assume that Jocko will be banging down my door any minute now.... PragerU is funded by oil billionaires, this is blatant propaganda üòÇ. Cole Bell no, it‚Äôs facts. Everything he said was facts. Most people are clueless or willfully ignorant when it comes to energy production ' transmission.Nothing has advanced or bettered the lives of humans more than fossil fuels, ever - it‚Äôs literall‚Ä¶See More.

Are we gonna just ignore that oil companies lobbied against actual science for years back in the 50s, 60s and 70s so they could avoid regulation? Nice try oil lobbyists.. Our plan has been around for 7 billion years and as seen many changes in the climatein that period of time. The sands of Africa used to be a rain forest as shown by many fossils. I do not personally feel there is an extreme threat with climate change at all but I do think it.is a way for the powers that are trying to take over running the USA to try to get‚Ä¶See More. Dottie Minnich the planet has been around for 7 billion years and has seen many mass extinctions. We are speeding up the process for the next one. This isn‚Äôt a matter of whether the planet will survive, the planet will obviously be fine. It‚Äôs habitability for human life is what‚Äôs coming into question.. Dottie Minnich Literally no scientific source says that. The figure is 4.54 billion, accurate to within 50 million. 7 billion years would make the Earth older than the solar system.. There's a big difference between a threat to the planet itself and a threat to the things living on the planet. And I'm not sure who you think the 'powers that are trying to take over running the USA' are, but when I think about people in the US with too much power, oil billionaires are some of the first people that come to mind, and they're the ones telling you not to worry about climate change.. Shawn Lada - I'd rather not look at AOC. Her real name is Sandy and I think she's a leftist- Completely.üôÉ People like her would bring great harm the United States of America.üá∫üá∏ I do think it's a good idea to cut down on our carbon usage but look it up‚Ä¶See More. No it's not. Look at AOC. She isnt a establishment Democrat. She wrote the bill to solve every problem we have that would impact the environment. If you actually understood the sciences of greenhouse gases and how we are defrosting all of the trees, th‚Ä¶See More. Dottie Minnich Citation needed. No seriously, I give you credit for admitting where you were wrong once, but you gotta do it quite a bit more because, well, you're dead wrong. Sandy? Wtf. If you want to know what a couple of fracking billionaires think of the Green New Deal, I suppose watch. But at least know who pays for PragerU's funding.. David Wright or anyone with common sense or knowledge on energy productionü§∑üèª_‚ôÇÔ∏è.... Bruh, you‚Äôre bankrolled by the fracking industry.This is widely available information.. This video goes to prove that the 'smart' and 'highly educated' are infact, not.. Kyle Egelhoff Im literally talking about solar panels being good. I mentioned solar batteries becuase solar panels can have batteries connected to them so they have extra charge for when the sun isn't shining- becuase the video completly ignored the fact that the power generated by solar panels could be stored and used later.. Your house runs on AC current not DC current. You can not store AC current in batteries. The energy in the powerlines are AC because it can travel farther then DC before losing energy. Yes it can be converted between the two, but there is always a loss‚Ä¶See More. Solar panels currently power american homes, I don't know why you are talking about solar panels like they are some impossible dream. This page is literally sponsored by the Koch brothers and other oil barons. PLEASE do your own research and don't trust these grifters.. NO GREEN DEAL..PERIOD... Betty Nana good to see you're keeping an open mind.. Betty Nana which one are you in the photo, the lady with the white hair in the center?. 'The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels' LMAO. Just so everyone knows, most of PragerU's early funding came from Dan and Farris Wilkes. Two brothers who started a fracking company. There is a reason PragerU shills for the fossil fuel industry.. Prager U would support hitler as long as he used fossil fuels at Aushwitz. We don't cotton to folks of the Epstein ilk round these parts no more, take yourself out SIR. bah!  Within ten years we'll be 100 percent wind, and solar!  Ray Kurzweil said so.. Our beaches are eroding and we have lost lots of island nations do to the rising water and sea levels. Aren't yall funded by the Koch Brothers lmao.. The deal with the green new deal is Prager has his head up his ass.. PragerU is funded by fossil fuel billionaires the Wilks brothers. Are you telling me a person whose entire funding is based on fossil fuels is against a plan that moves away from fossil fuels?. The fact that he said nuclear energy is the safest form of energy is actually hilarious I guess they don't know about Chernobyl incident and how it was one of the worst nuclear disaster in human history or how fossil fuels are a leading cause of global‚Ä¶See More.

Oscar Wilhelmy nuclear energy is dangerous it could literally destroy a whole country or a city. It bothers me how people's entire perception of nuclear energy is based primarily on the failures of two or three specific locations: Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011), and Three Mile Island (1979, if you're in the US). France's energy grid is around ‚Ä¶See More. This is how you know Prager is a toxic sellout media outlet!. What ‚Äúmoral case‚Äù for fossil fuels? There is no moral case for fossil fuels. Any relation to the other Epstein?. There are many scientists that don't agree. This is about Obama billions of dollars inestments and all  crap going on today.. They aren't even an educational institute. I see that oil money is being put to good use by ya'll eh?. Some talking head paid by the oil lobby, man I'm so interested on his thoughts on Greene energy and fossil fuels! I can imagine they align with, fossil fuel good green energy bad, even though it's a growing industry. How are you going to power New York City? 10billion wind turbines?! Store the energy in a battery the size of a building?  Nuclear is the future folks!. WE ARE ALREADY  USING RECYCLED MATERIALS FROM THE EARTH THAT WORK PRETTY WELL!. If oil companies are so profitable, why do they STILL need to be subsidized? China is going to be ahead of us because they're moving to better sources of energy faster, while the oil companies in the US fund idiots like  Prager U to spread propaganda and  keep them in business, so they won't have to keep up with the times. They profit short-term, the entire country loses in the long term.. PragerU is not a real university.. Hey all you believe green new deal so much. How many of you want to chip and buy me a Cyber truck. Otherwise im gunna need gas still. I'm just impressed by the mental gymnastics and rhetorical tapdancing on display here. Well, that and this dude's perpetual constipated look.. funny how i see this video just as there‚Äôs floods in mexico, texas, china, and india .... the earth is getting tired of our bullshit. because of people like this we‚Äôre all going to go extinct.. Shilling for the destruction of our planet and extinction of ours and many other species, anything for the almighty dollar, your one true god right?. Hey Prager U where'd'ja get the money for this video?. So CO2 is the reason for longer life expectancy and not modern medicine and a deeper understanding of modern science ü§î seems legit.. Oil companies have time and money to transition into clean energy companies, but they're not going to do that until they sell every drop of oil!. You never know. There was an oil billionaire who said, 'We didn't leave the stone age because we ran out of stone' so there's definitely some trying to get the jump.. You almost have to respect PragerU for this video. Most right wing media propaganda will tell you that rise in co2 levels are a hoax or something like that. But they lean into it. Not only are they rising but that‚Äôs good. It makes ‚Äúglobal greening.‚Äù Don‚Äôt worry about where Florida went, now we grow corn at the North Pole. You win some you lose some.. Daniel Podesta the best lies contain some truth in them.. C'mon, commenters. Do you really think the fracking billionaire-funded organization is intentionally trying to mislead the public? It's not like this is part of a consistent misinformation campaign spearheaded by the very people falsely claiming to be climate experts.Oh wait... https:''features.weather.com'course-climate-misinformation'. In these times when the American right is actually gaining credibility and making intellectually sound arguments against the crazed out left, the right's denial on climate brings all of that credibility back down. We should stop listening to people who take a narrative driven stance, right or left. Listen to people who consistently take a data driven stance. Data = truth.. The data is that Solar and Wind is ineffective and wastes more materials and kills more wildlife respectively.The data is that The Green New Deal has nothing to do with conserving the Environment.. https:''youtu.be'1zrejG-WI3U. Climate deniers are stupid mfers.. A lot of people on here informing us that Prager is funded by oil lobbiests, but no one providing information on why the information is false.. Valerie Cihak I didnt even watch the video and I can summarize it for you. Either they are claiming the science isnt there to prove C02 has an impact on the warming of the earth or humans aren't as responsible for it. Either way it's just propaganda. Conservatives and Libertarians are too goddamned stupid to fact check anything, and expect others to provide them with information they're not interested in, and will refuse to believe no matter how well documented the facts are.. Love getting information from a dude who wrote for the Ayn Rand Institute and was funded by the Koch brothers speaking in a video by a right wing think tank that is funded by fracking billionaires and exists solely to spew corporate propaganda üëçüèª. https:''www.youtube.com'watch?v=VxWYglbtqnQ. Elijah White No one's saying that the world is *literally* going to end in 12 years.The more salient point is that we have a 12 year window to prevent a large amount of warming that will cost us a significant amount of money over the next 100 years.. Idk why everyone thinks this is a great idea this is why so many states always vote red because everytime democrats get in a lot of republicans lose their jobs without a new job in site they should really add the jobs first then start the process of moving people to the new jobs or red will continue to vote red for not only that reason but several more. Lmao why do y'all wanna fight so hard for shitty coal jobs? If you put half that energy into moving forward we'd be much closer to a world of plenty.. Good to see a majority of people don't buy into Prager's bullshit--literal propaganda machine based on nothing but common ignorance's ability to believe whatever pops up on the news feed.. 'Thank you oil daddies for all the oil money! we'll be sure to bash anything close to reigning in your blood thirsty practices'- PragerU. Currently 66 very clueless, or very stupid people laughing at this. He is 100% correct. I work in the energy industry, and I know what it entails. It‚Äôs not as simple as so many brainwashed people think it is. And the climate ‚Äúthreat‚Äù leftists keep talking about is next to nothing - it‚Äôs a manufactured crisis just like every other corrupt Leftist cause.. Shannon Wagner Agenda 21. What about hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and nuclear power? Wind and solar are only 2 options.. Ryan Hathaway it framed the comment about 'no country being even 50%' and led the audience the believe that meant renewable. Two countries have reached 100% renewable but they didn't EXCLUSIVELY use wind and solar. It's just short of being a lie.. Nuclear, geothermal, geomagnetic. You missed a few green energies. Ryan Kish did you actually watch the video? He clearly talks about Nuclear energy and it's part.. Matt Clodfelter meant more towards thorium should have been little more specific. This comment section gave me a tiny smidgen of hope!. Nice try, Epstein.

"5653. Whoever wrote 5606 I think I know who you are talking about because they dined and dashed on me because I was against the revolution. I was friends with these two girls and one guy freshman year. They asked me what my parents did and I said they both were nurses, and that I was on financial aid. Mind you, my mom is a school nurse and makes nowhere near the amount of hospital nurses.  From then on, they began treating me differently. Suddenly they would hang out without ...me and I know they should talk a lot of shit about how I was rich. One day I ran out of money on my metrocard downtown in a station where there were no machines. I asked if I could borrow a swipe and I would repay them for it. I was cursed out on the middle of the platform because it was apparently rude to offer them money just because they were poor. I didn't understand why it was rude because I would have given anyone the 2.75 and knew nothing about his financial situation. When I said that he told me to stop lying and refused to speak to me on the entire ride home.  A few weeks later, we all went to an all you can eat sushi place in Queens and I was really excited. We went and ate a bunch because it was pretty pricy (like 40 bucks a person) plus some of us got beers too. Both of my female friends decided to go to the bathroom and then I was alone with my guy friend. Things were still weird between us and after a few minutes, he said he was going to check on our other friends. When I offered to go with him, he said I shouldn't because the wait staff needed to know that we didn't dine and dash. So he left and then I was alone at the table to only find out that they all dined and dashed me.  They texted me that they left me with the bill because of how mad my male friend was as a result of the metrocard thing. They mentioned something about how my actions showed that I was against the revolution. I shit you not paying someone back in their minds is anti-communist. It literally made no sense. I tried paying the entire bill which was well over 200 with tip and tax, but my card only had around 80 dollars on it because I had paid for a textbook earlier that day. I had to wait an hour and a half in the restaurant sobbing until my parents could come down from New Jersey and give me the rest of the money. One of them had the audacity to wish me a happy birthday the next week.  I've heard from other people on campus that they've done this kind of stuff to them too. They're fully a group of uneducated people who think they're swindling the rich by actually fucking over their peers, who aren't even wealth.

"Homeowners are about to get hit with a big new fee: Starting next month, all home mortgages that are refinanced will have to pay half of 1% of the loan upfront ‚Äî as much as $1,500 for a $300,000 mortgage.","My refinance is already well underway. So hopefully I should be able to avoid this.. Jebadiah Stonewall Bacon - push your LO and processor you get you closed and funded by the end of the month!. You should be good.  If you're just doing a regular refi and have no issues with your paperwork, it shouldn't take more than two weeks to close.. So glad my refinance literally finished today and is being funded on Monday..... I got mine approved last month, thank goodness. Bummer. I was planning on refinancing in the near future. Luckily this will not be a huge barrier for me but it will definitely give me a reason to reconsider moving forward with refinancing.. You already have to pay closing costs when you refinance.. Refinancing for cash out and paying off high interest debt  is also a no win situation with IRS tax laws changed under quiet tax reforms of three years ago.. ‚ÄúAnd they say banks and other lenders are making record profits on refinanced loans, so they don't necessarily have to pass along the added cost to homeowners.‚ÄùThat is hysterical.. Keith Esterly it's not a bug of capitalism, it's a feature.. So don't refinance. Even without the new fee, it takes years to make up the other fees that they always charged, even with a lower rate. Just keep plugging away at the original mortgage.. Debbie Fromer We‚Äôre saving $600 a month by refinancing because rates have changed so, so much since we bought our house. It will take less than 2 years to recoup the cost of the refinance, which was rolled into the loan anyway so we only have to worry about that if we sell in the next 2 years. It can absolutely be worth it.. Debbie Fromer silly you. Are that figures into the spread. You seem like you really don‚Äôt understand simple finance. Spread is what your current all in cost is vs what your new all in cost is. I hate to think you believe yourself capable to advise people on refi.. Debbie Fromer Some people have no other choice right now.. Debbie Fromer I get the feeling you don't really know what you're talking about.. The rates are so low that refinancing helps those who need it the most (by lowering their payments). Refinancing actually makes it more likely they won't need to default, so the reasoning is crap.. Yeah that's not helpful if you already did lol. Debbie Fromer May or may not have been a great deal, but I chose a higher interest rate than offered in order to have the lender credits to cover all closing costs.  I wanted to be ahead from day one.. Debbie Fromer   Why aren‚Äôt the red blooded Mercans with their 2A righteousness not out shooting Mitch an The Donald and anyone else standing in the way of Freedumb ?. Joe Dufour, plus the other bank charges. The $1500 is only one of them.. Mikel Podgursky McLaughlin, what does ‚Äúwalked away with $500 at closing mean?‚Äú Does that mean you only paid $500 in fees to refinance?. not always true....depends on how old the loan is and the rate;. Yes, I shouldnt cut my term nor my rate in half because you told me so. What you're saying is misleading.  It greatly depends on what rate you're paying versus what your new rate will be.  And if you're refi'ing with a trustworthy company, they'll let you know if its worth it financially.  I refi'd last month and went from‚Ä¶See More. as a loan officer...this sucks, but i understand it's because they are expecting lots of foreclosures soon......

My interest went down 1.25% by switching to a local credit union. Plus, the process pushed a payment back a month which means a lot to us ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù.. Such a crock. We‚Äôre not making enough off of you for doing nothing, so if you try to cut into our income, we will find you and charge you. Meanwhile, as your bank, we will provide less service to you as we strive to be more efficient to our shareholder‚Ä¶See More. Now is the time to help ppl, not attach more fees to something they're already paying for. Mortgage Rate down,so they get  money from you , another way. I am so thankful I don‚Äôt have a Mortgage anymore.. It's all for profits. It always has been.. Sounds more like a prepayment penalty....what BS. Aside: are homeowners who are in the market to refinance right now really the people who need relief the most?. Kenny Satterlee it was with the current lender. Carl Beutler  yes!. Carl Beutler refinancing isn‚Äôt relief.. Keith Esterly it can be relief if their payments drop a few hundred dollars.... a matter of individual perspective. Carl Beutler The fee wasn't charged until now.. Ilana Weisel I would say it‚Äôs arguably one of the best parts of Obama‚Äôs TARP initiative were modifications! I hope it worked out for you!. Big deal. Over the life of a 15-30 year mortgage, this fee is a drop in the hat when you actually consider the difference paid between a 4 or 5% interest rate vs. a 2.5 or 3% interest rate.Refinance. While you're at it, refinance to a 15 year.. Kristin Schultz The fee is often required to be paid up front when refinancing. That can be thousands in cash that many people simply don‚Äôt have right now.. Thanks Trump.  You pick only the best people.. So if you have excess money and dont neex a refinance....theyll refinance you. One more knife in the back of the middle and lower class. That's really not that bad considering... even so, I would challenge it in court if it isnt explicitly in the contract. Brian McCarten yeah üëè. Considering what?. Considering most of the country doesnt own a 300,000 house and even if they did 1,500 isnt that much compared to the money saved on the life of the mortgage.... ‚Äú.... Trump administration-appointed regulators at the Federal Housing Finance Agency who approved the new fee.‚Äù. Mari Mari yep, no surprise. Leave it to Trump!. Dang!  Looks like we refi'd just in time!  Closed about a month ago.  Got a nice 2.99 on a 30-year.. Can anyone explain why they aren't saying '.5 % of the loan' and are saying 'half of 1 %'?. Average Americans don't math.. Mark Flanagan false. Please try again.. Nate Sullivan trish better not bump this into September!. Sam Cruz Jr. Will this happen to me?. Matt Grieger. David Bannister. Cammy Donnen. Laura Mast. Sounds like my fee may be around $600? If I did the math correctly?. Jimena Rojas Amurrio something to think about. Let Flor know.. Matthew Fante-Becker. Helen Amodio do you know anything about this?. Closed on Monday and got funds today.   Phew.  Debt consolidation and lower interest rate made this worthwhile.. Welp they're predicting a catastrophe. Tracy Lichlyter Smith. Amanda Kay Boulden Dwayne Wells. Emily Lasley Habermeyer. Katie Renee. Dana Gendron. Loey Peete. James. Kaitlin Waite. Aimee Fluitt ugh. Still worth it. Jenna Hiebertüò¨.

"#6742 #13054 *** Important PSA *** If your ""programming"" language uses 1-indexing, it isn't a real programming language. For those of you who won't have financial security when you graduate (i.e. non-CS concentrators), 1-indexing is when you access the first element of some object with some variant of ""object[1]"" (this runs contrary to ""object[0]"" for real programming languages). Don't you even question me about R. That's not even a real language, it's just for bio majors to pretend like they know a thing or two about statistics. Its variable assignment operator is an abomination; its syntax is as if a middle schooler decided then and there that they wanted to create a new programming language. I mean seriously, using x <- 5 rather than x = 5? You're even worse than JavaScript! And I'm going to flip my shit if you bring up MATLAB. Fuck that shitty ass excuse for coding that the ""real engineers"" use. I'm sorry, semicolons aren't just a syntactic thing? Also, stop fucking up my laptop. I'm tired as shit about the computer fans whizzing every 5 minutes while I try to run this thing. I don't give a fuck about all your cool packages with remote-control cars or machine learning - the python packages are simply superior. Also, you have to use ""end"" lines to divide up your loops and switches? Fuck me. You can't develop noteworthy software in either of these pathetic excuse for languages.

UPDATE, comrade is looking to get access to now an updated 2K: 1696.13/2000$ Previous: 150/100$ Hey comrades!!! ^^  A Black comrade of mine is in urgent need of mutual aid in order to help survive the persistent violent conditions of antiBlackness and capital. This aid is urgent. Its urgent not only because in the abstract it would help secure matierals which are nessecary for life for my comrade (food, water, transportation, etc), but also more trenchantly, because this aid is nessecary in order to support their continual resistance to the genocidal conditions of antiBlack violence which are constantly conferred onto them. AntiBlackness accumulates matierality for white and/or non-Black people through exporting gratutious violence against Blackness. This means for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, the matierality that we have (regardless of how much) is indivisibly tied to the rendering fungible, dispossession, and eradication of Blackness that is integral to the antagonism of antiBlackness. Given this, and as one small piece in the larger nessecary commitment to aiding Black liberation, it means that for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, we must redistribute the matierality that we have back to Black people by any means nessecary!!! My comrade is in need, so lets get to this!!! It is absolutely nessecary!!! ‚úä‚úä‚úä my comrade has asked that if you do have the ability to give, that you should direct it to my Cashapp (which I will then transfer to them) at: $schizobitch  You can also send monetary aid to their GFM, which is: https://www.gofundme.com/f/vytsdd-kemp-family‚Ä¶ If you can or cant aid matierally, please boost and share!!!","I love you so much, my girlfriend",[],[],[],['love'],['girlfriend'],{'girlfriend': 1.0}

"""Schools are essential to the functioning of our society, and that makes teachers essential workers. They should rise to the occasion even if it makes them nervous, just like health-care workers have,"" Kristen McConnell writes.","Please stop posting this. She is wrong. This is wrong. Education is essential. Schools are not. Teachers did not sign on to risk their lives. Nurses signed on to save lives at all costs, even a risk to their own. No comparison. We shouldn't be exposing nurses to unnecessary risk, either.That said, people are in hospitals to save their lives. Grouping people in schools endangers their lives. It isn't worth the risk to anyone.. Saddle Rivera I agree. I know that feeling of unknown these teachers and children are going into. They shouldn‚Äôt be forced to.. Aaron Mikey as a nurse myself I couldn‚Äôt agree with her more ü§∑üèº‚ôÄÔ∏è. Aaron Mikey a nurse has proper PPE. Teachers don't. Nurses have training on how to handle infectious diseases. Teachers don't.. Lisa Anna I think they repost bc they know it's controversial and people will argue resulting in clicks and comments... Also, having teachers not go into schools is more likely to save nurse lives. She's literally making her job harder.. Lisa Anna I agree!. Lisa Anna also lets talk about compensating like an essential worker.. Lisa, The socialization, conflict resolution, brain storming, teamwork development, and physical development kids get in school is something they won‚Äôt get sitting in front of a computer.. ‚Ä¶See More. Aaron Mikey , off course not. Look, this is a personal attention seeking story of two people who want a reality show. Does it even make sense that a nurse who is supposed to be overwhelmed has time to write this, and that a nurse would promote an action that would cause the healthcare units to overload?. Lisa Anna  not true. Nurses were instructed annually in disaster preparation, including adequate PPE & government led response.. Sherisse McLaurin exactly. I‚Äôm so tired of the Hero Teacher narrative.  I teach science to high schoolers.  I can do that adequately without them physically being present.  My students are old enough to stay home alone if necessary, so I do not even provide daycare.  While I enj‚Ä¶See More. Manda Linn amen! We've heard the hero narrative for weeks with my district's reopening push and then saying that we can't call ourselves heroes if we refuse to get back in the classroom. Sick of it.. Great. I'll see one prescreened child at a time, by appointment only, in a completely sterile environment, in full scrubs for 10-15 min then send them home. And the parents can come too, be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it's their turn. I'll see 15 children a day.. So many wonderful people in healthcare. And then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with. They think the whole workforce is to meet their standard. There are many occupations that deserve equal respect‚Ä¶See More. Saddle Rivera When DJT‚Äôs kid goes back to school & when he opens back up the White House then we‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs safe!. I whole heartedly agree...As an RN for 40 years this article made me both sad and angry. This is not a way to promote public heath or support parents in such hard times. This nation has let down BOTH its nurses and its teachers along with every America‚Ä¶See More. James Troutman, I honestly think he'd make his kid go to school like his buddy Putin had his daughter take a 2nd Phase Covid Vaccine. Btw, did Trump's younger brother just die of Covid after Trump had him take the hydroxychloroquine. Just thinkin. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Nick LaCerva she probably doesn't care... Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. üëç... this is just a Trumpie ...NTY gives space to Cotton, Newsweek to that old lawyer and The Atlantic to this nurse .... SAME ..... I‚Äôve been a teacher, healthcare worker now.Stop giving nurses so much attention üòé. Jacki Webb üíØ%. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Andrew Hsieh this. üíØ. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.   If it  is  not  safe  for  football,  theaters,  and  innperson in person meetings,  kids  do  not  need  to  go  to in  person  school.. Angie Johnson Krivchenia True. But the administration wants the economy back rather than safety from COVID. 'It is what it is...' Trump.. So I have been a nurse for over 40 years, still working in a hospital. I know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe.  Teachers are educators and don't need to put their safety at risk and be exposed to Covid, period. Teachers shoul‚Ä¶See More. It's not their work, it's who they work with. Kids and families and all the other people out of the house because schools are open (so parents can work) and in risk of infection. A nurse just stays in hospital waiting for sick people to go to them. Even in lockdown.. I guess that nurse wants to keep ‚Äúdoing her job‚Äù because kids going to school is going to make more sick patients.. Also, that‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve heard.. I kinda feel sorry for her husband.. The difference is that Nurses save lives when they show up to work. Teachers coming in will cause more people to end up at the hospital. How does that help you, Nurse?. You chose healthcare and the potential risk that came with it. Teachers chose education and the lower risk of being exposed to kids with sniffles. Big difference.. Said what I said... this is a cold human being PERIOD. Cant compare nurses with teachers. THATS the point..... Hess Reunion umm I never attended the university of Phoenix. I have a masters in special education and a license in elementary, alternative and secondary social studies. What‚Äôs your point.. Hess Reunion and I‚Äôm a NP.....I‚Äôd also like to know your point?. Anthony Jason Warren I don‚Äôt disagree. At least they are only having brief interactions...but still.. Leigh Taylor haters are gonna hate... Let‚Äôs pay teachers what nurses and doctors make first, and then we can have this discussion. Also let‚Äôs make sure teachers have other staff to do all the cleaning too, and then again, we can have that discussion.. Hardly, there is liability in every job and because of that, you get trained to deal with that liability. People who choose to work in 'dangerous' professions, know what they are signing up for when they enrolled in school. Teaching is not meant to be ‚Ä¶See More. Schools are not funded like hospitals.  Ours is not air-conditioned, with poor air circulation, no way to social distance and in a small space for 7 hours I a day with little kids who may or may not be wearing a mask. Nurses keep people alive. In person school isn't worth anyone's life. Not teachers ', not students', not parents', not grandparents'.. As a nurse, people rely on you to help them get better when they're sick. In other words: if you don't do your job, they might die and they have to see you in person in order for you to help them. You cannot treat people for Covid-19 remotely.As a tea‚Ä¶See More. Bullshit. The kids aren't in going to school because their lives are in danger. In fact, going to school can and WILL put their lives at risk, and especially the teachers. The teachers' efforts aren't saving the lives of their students.Also... PPE...‚Ä¶See More. and just in case anyone thinks kids aren't at risk, we've already had multiple outbreaks around the country because of KIDS! Kids going to camp, kids going back to school, kids doing sports... This is the most absurd argument for public health I've ever heard in my life!. And patients aren't grouped together in one room. Can you imagine having 20 patients in one room and trying to keep them from being exposed to each other.  And kids aren't in bed they're up running around. There is no comparison.. They should be given the proper tools to do their job. Historically, this has not happened.. The Atlantic we‚Äôre in the midst of a public health emergency and y‚Äôall look like clowns publishing this opinion-based nonsense. signed, a covid icu nurse who doesn‚Äôt want to risk unnecessary exposure for teachers and families. See the thing is, she *chose* the healthcare field knowing the risk of exposure to communicable diseases; teachers chose the field of education to *educate* people.  The thing about opinions is that they are like assholes...everybody has one...and some actually *are* one.  Let me guess...she‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúnurses‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt believe in vaccines and has an essential oil for everything üôÑ. Kristin Humbles so by her (mis)logic, I would be led to assume that nurse who care for children who are hospitalized also teach whatever lessons their classmates are being taught in school that day.. Kristin Humbles it is.. Ron it is the comment section after all ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è. ...wtf, so everyone needs to expose themselves to the risk of sacrificing themselves or family members for the good of the masses?. Teachers can teach remotely. Nurses generally need to be in the company of patients.. No. Health care workers agreed to work in health care. Teachers did not.. So you, as a nurse, can be overwhelmed again? Logic? You do realize nothing about the virus has changed, right?. a teachers job is not to put their lives on the line bc a country doesn't have adequate familial support to allow people to quit their jobs and shelter in their house with their families. jesus america is scary. The issue is not only are teachers and other staff ‚Äîand their families-exposed to a potentially deadly illnesss but so are schoolchildren‚Äîand their families.  And anyone who comes into contact with them.  What the nation needs now is a nation wide stay‚Ä¶See More. I don't want my kids to go to school. I'll deal with the distance learning. Schools can't seem to manage bullying. Imagine bullying by exposing kids to Covid? Teachers can teach through Zoom ... Protect themselves as well ... & I am a healthcare worker. How many nurses, doctors and staff died? People have to go to hospitals. Kids don't have to go to a building in a crowd and become little carriers.. Can a nurse do their job remotely? Regrettably, no. There are jobs that most be done in person.Teaching can be done online. ‚ÄúYou gotta do it because I had to do it.‚Äù is lazy thinking.. I signed up to teach kids.

The Trump administration plans to withdraw William Perry Pendley as its nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management.

Catherine, that‚Äôs his idea, destroy from Within.  DeVos is a clear example.. Destructionists. yep, look at Dejoy and Devos.. Jerry JB I agree Jerry. It‚Äôs going to take a long time to undo the damage, if that‚Äôs possible. I was an NRA member and took Hunter Safety courses. Now it‚Äôs all about the Benjamins. Pretty sad.. Catherine Howard exactly. Yes. I wonder why only this time, the criticism caused a withdrawal.. Catherine Howard Deconstruction is still the plan.. Jerry JB completely agree.. TRUE!! In fact...they are there to DESTROY  what their in charge of!! Every one of them!!. Justin Parton true that.. Catherine Howard That's a fact! He is evil!. Catherine Howard ALWAYS. Well said. Catherine Howard absolutely true. And his idea of protect means: make money off of.... Justin Parton Correct, hunting and hunters fund a large portion of conservation efforts.  Not all hunters are crazy MAGA 2nd Amendment nuts.  For a lot of people in this country, hunting is an important tradition and equates to spending time with and learning from family.  As long as you‚Äôre responsible and respectful, hunting can be seen as more respectable than just buying slaughter house fodder.. Catherine Howard   always. Catherine Howard It‚Äôs almost like him and his followers hate America.. Jerry JB I have yet to meet ANYONE who didn't have an ancestor who was a hunter. I'm 67 years old. Well, if you break an agency, you can say that it doesn't work and sunset it.. Catherine Howard So true.. Catherine Howard exactly!!!. Catherine Howard Yeah. Like getring one of the most ignorant people he knows to run the Department of Education. What's up with that? Those are the 'very best people' he pledged to help run his administration? Really?. Catherine Howard Cruella DeVilles every one.. Catherine Howard exactly.. Catherine Howard I‚Äôm waiting for him to appoint Farmer John to head the Union of Orthodox Rabbis.. Catherine Howard That is the plan of this administration, to dismantle all the departments and destroy the U.S. as we know it.  That‚Äôs why all the wolves are put in charge of the hen houses.. This is good news but may just mean that he‚Äôs knows he won‚Äôt get approved. Pendley is already acting director so my guess is Trump will keep him on till the end of his term to do as many evil deeds as possible.. Daniel Collay it‚Äôs political theater. Odds are good Trump will lose, so what‚Äôs the point of filling a post for a few months at best?. Which just means he has found someone equally unqualified.. Or worse.. Barbara Havens Joe Exotic?. All public lands and the natural resources therein should first supplement old age pension and public healthcare.  And held in perpeturity  for this purpose.. John Kimball Great idea, try getting current politicians to do it!. This is a start, but he must be REMOVED, and not allowed to remain as acting director. Tell your elected representatives.. Raising hell MATTERS! Keep marching, keep contacting elected officials!. Selling off our federal lands would be a huge mistake‚Ä¶ They are our national heritage and draw tourists from all over the world. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll have a new nominee just as bad if not worse.. For those of us with short memories due to his chaotic leadership, the damage started long before this guy. https:''thehill.com'...'421910-undoing-the-damage-pruitt.... Carol Perry Macholl As I stated earlier, remove ANY politician that has served more than 8 years! Nancy, Chuck, etc. They have already become multimillionaires AT OUR expense.. In not so many months, all of the clown‚Äôs nominations will be in the unemployment line.. Randy Jeffers Who would ‚Äúyour man‚Äù nominate? AOC, Bernie, Omar, Or some other radical fool?. Most likely a legitimate authority on land management. I know, radical, huh? I'm glad you've clarified that stuffing your pockets at the expense of the people is now the mainstream conservative ethos.. Why is Trump even nominating anyone for any position right now? He has no idea whether he‚Äôll have a second term (let‚Äôs hope not). By the time anyone gets confirmed, it would be just about time to vacate their office when Trump gets escorted out of the White House.. What?  He found somebody worse?  Less qualified?  More interested in gutting the land, air, and water than this twit?  Wow!. Kudrun Pilegrim nah, just a bigger donor.... You win. Kudrun Pilegrim no, the guy remains in the job and continues to lead without senate confirmation. Just another end run around congress.. Probably just decided he was needed more over at the USPS..

So now they‚Äôre going to find someone else who doesn‚Äôt have easily discoverable statements in support of selling off federal land?. Exactly.  Since when has anybody who left the Trump administration been replaced by somebody more capable and less corrupt than the temporary appointee that couldn't even pass congressional approve if Mitch had been doing his job?. Andrew Chipperfield true. HOW ARE THERE STILL POSITIONS TO NOMINATE?! The term ends in January!. Javier I√±√≥n People said the same thing in 2016.. 4 years later and he still can't get the job done he promised us would be done by April 2017.What a terrible leader.. Most federal agencies are being run by 'acting' appointments because Trump knows he can't get them confirmed.. very different year.. The Trump administration holds the record for the most unfilled positions. Majority is being run by temps. He‚Äôll just hire a guy that thinks the same but hasn‚Äôt talked about it publicly. Don‚Äôt even start to think he‚Äôs changing his mind about selling off land. He‚Äôs just going to sneak it through.. good.  but the fact trump even considered him is yet another reason to VOTE in historical numbers this Nove to remove him.... He must not have donated enough to Donny's campaign.. Jan Moody Garner both sides take lobbyists money silly. Jan Moody Garner. Just another corrupt wealthy Trump supporter put in place to help his own business in exchange for an illegal campaign donation that somehow landed in Trump‚Äôs personal bank account.

"""Schools are essential to the functioning of our society, and that makes teachers essential workers. They should rise to the occasion even if it makes them nervous, just like health-care workers have,"" Kristen McConnell writes.","Please stop posting this. She is wrong. This is wrong. Education is essential. Schools are not. Teachers did not sign on to risk their lives. Nurses signed on to save lives at all costs, even a risk to their own. No comparison. We shouldn't be exposing nurses to unnecessary risk, either.That said, people are in hospitals to save their lives. Grouping people in schools endangers their lives. It isn't worth the risk to anyone.. Kelli Anderson-Jansen as a nurse who respects teachers with every ounce of my heart, I don‚Äôt think you guys should be forced to go through what the nursing workforce had to and is still going through. We did not sign up to risk our lives, we signed up ‚Ä¶See More. Aaron Mikey as a nurse myself I couldn‚Äôt agree with her more ü§∑üèº‚ôÄÔ∏è. Aaron Mikey a nurse has proper PPE. Teachers don't. Nurses have training on how to handle infectious diseases. Teachers don't.. Lisa Anna I think they repost bc they know it's controversial and people will argue resulting in clicks and comments... Lisa, The socialization, conflict resolution, brain storming, teamwork development, and physical development kids get in school is something they won‚Äôt get sitting in front of a computer.. ‚Ä¶See More. Lisa Anna also lets talk about compensating like an essential worker.. Does anyone care about the kids catching this virus? Kids possibly dying? Or their family members? Spreading the disease? This is beyond the economics or politics. This is a PANDEMIC! It may not kill you but you can spread it to someone else and it cou‚Ä¶See More. I‚Äôm so tired of the Hero Teacher narrative.  I teach science to high schoolers.  I can do that adequately without them physically being present.  My students are old enough to stay home alone if necessary, so I do not even provide daycare.  While I enj‚Ä¶See More. Manda Linn amen! We've heard the hero narrative for weeks with my district's reopening push and then saying that we can't call ourselves heroes if we refuse to get back in the classroom. Sick of it.. Manda Linn Its all just so disheartening how people are so angry and demanding about getting their kids out of the house no matter what the cost.  Like their convenience is more important than the health and safety of their own kids and us.  I will nev‚Ä¶See More. I don't like the hero title myself as a nurse. It puts a responsibility where it doesn't belong.. Meghan ElizabethYou are so right! So eloquently put! It is disheartening, dehumanizing, emotionally violent, and physically dangerous what much of America is asking; nay, demanding of our teachers right now! It's outrageous and it's wrong. And I suppo‚Ä¶See More. Great. I'll see one prescreened child at a time, by appointment only, in a completely sterile environment, in full scrubs for 10-15 min then send them home. And the parents can come too, be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it's their turn. I'll see 15 children a day.. So many wonderful people in healthcare. And then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with. They think the whole workforce is to meet their standard. There are many occupations that deserve equal respect‚Ä¶See More. Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Pretty sh*tty to pit two professions that have been so mistreated during the pandemic against each other. That said, if you‚Äôve never taught in a public school, you have no idea how impossible it is to keep yourself and a classroom full of kids from spreading this virus.. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.   If it  is  not  safe  for  football,  theaters,  and  innperson in person meetings,  kids  do  not  need  to  go  to in  person  school.. So I have been a nurse for over 40 years, still working in a hospital. I know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe.  Teachers are educators and don't need to put their safety at risk and be exposed to Covid, period. Teachers shoul‚Ä¶See More. It's not their work, it's who they work with. Kids and families and all the other people out of the house because schools are open (so parents can work) and in risk of infection.

I guess that nurse wants to keep ‚Äúdoing her job‚Äù because kids going to school is going to make more sick patients.","['compensating', 'actively', 'physically', 'susceptible', 'occupations', 'clicks', 'infectious', 'classroom']","['jobs', 'resources', 'community', 'exposed', 'economics', 'occupations', 'virtually', 'conflict', 'compensating', 'physically', 'controversial', 'job', 'exposing', 'adequately', 'physical', 'funded', 'adequate', 'text', 'maintain', 'ultimately']","['convenience', 'unnecessary', 'workforce', 'actively']","['rapid', 'also', 'worth', 'job', 'important', 'essential', 'health', 'away', 'maintain', 'even', 'responsibility', 'sick', 'proper', 'old', 'alone', 'hero', 'risk', 'impossible', 'guess', 'everyone', 'return', 'wait', 'hospital', 'completely', 'refuse', 'without', 'get', 'reduce', 'adequate', 'car', 'deserve', 'beyond', 'child', 'talk', 'much', 'someone', 'appointment', 'controversial', 'angry', 'call', 'back', 'high', 'house', 'stop', 'handle', 'full', 'work', 'dangerous', 'like', 'keep', 'never', 'need', 'teach', 'one', 'kill', 'family', 'wonderful', 'safe', 'really', 'home', 'still', 'right', 'argue', 'anyone', 'sign', 'every', 'care', 'title', 'government', 'safety', 'school', 'virtually', 'matter', 'think', 'see', 'ultimately', 'text', 'whole', 'equal', 'front', 'people', 'idea', 'spread', 'go', 'come', 'open', 'may', 'public', 'development', 'something', 'science', 'narrative', 'many', 'meet', 'try', 'push', 'provide', 'physical', 'else', 'person', 'increase', 'community', 'brain', 'know', 'agree', 'conflict', 'save', 'mean', 'make', 'send', 'put', 'possibly', 'enough', 'plan', 'realize', 'nurse', 'absolutely', 'stay']","['people', 'high', 'hero', 'lisa', 'person', 'many', 'lives', 'health', 'nurse', 'schools', 'kids', 'workforce', 'anyone', 'teachers', 'essential', 'risk', 'work', 'full', 'sick', 'school', 'narrative', 'adequate']","{'teachers': 0.021891914511976033, 'kids': 0.0162222979390843, 'people': 0.01172916913190105, 'nurse': 0.011296660188495324, 'school': 0.010191190251101993, 'risk': 0.009967032376858153, 'schools': 0.009919425220753467, 'essential': 0.009653112909639203, 'anyone': 0.009627099210758378, 'full': 0.009558810056810476, 'lisa': 0.009321720173611112, 'many': 0.009215682838422917, 'workforce': 0.008325871913580246, 'high': 0.008325871913580246, 'adequate': 0.008325871913580246, 'person': 0.008225008655855067, 'lives': 0.007858097151240279, 'health': 0.007857515632419279, 'sick': 0.0077810766489702825, 'hero': 0.007763861882716048, 'narrative': 0.007763861882716048, 'work': 0.007702025992105889}"
The Trump administration plans to withdraw William Perry Pendley as its nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management. Pendley has faced criticism for past statements in support of selling off federal public land.,"his nominees are always the antithesis of what they are charged to oversee and protect.  Always.. Catherine, that‚Äôs his idea, destroy from Within.  DeVos is a clear example.. Destructionists. yep, look at Dejoy and Devos.. Catherine Howard Scott Pruitt sued the EPA 18 times while he was AG in Oklahoma. That‚Äôs a great resume for Trump. It will take years to undo the damage. Look at who he made Postmaster General. A huge donor to the campaign. The most corrupt administration ever. This guy makes Nixon look like a Cub Scout.. Catherine Howard exactly. Yes. I wonder why only this time, the criticism caused a withdrawal.. Catherine Howard Deconstruction is still the plan.. Randall Bratton , His son Donald Trump Jr probably. He understands how important protecting wildlife and habitats are. He's stopped him from doing damaging stuff in Alaska.. TRUE!! In fact...they are there to DESTROY  what their in charge of!! Every one of them!!. Justin Parton but only  so junior has someplace to kill wildlife.. This is good news but may just mean that he‚Äôs knows he won‚Äôt get approved. Pendley is already acting director so my guess is Trump will keep him on till the end of his term to do as many evil deeds as possible.. Daniel Collay it‚Äôs political theater. Odds are good Trump will lose, so what‚Äôs the point of filling a post for a few months at best?. Which just means he has found someone equally unqualified.. Selling off our federal lands would be a huge mistake‚Ä¶ They are our national heritage and draw tourists from all over the world. All public lands and the natural resources therein should first supplement old age pension and public healthcare.  And held in perpeturity  for this purpose.. This is a start, but he must be REMOVED, and not allowed to remain as acting director. Tell your elected representatives.. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll have a new nominee just as bad if not worse..

"What lesson can we learn from pandemics throughout history? Don't miss the exclusive conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser, and other experts from National Geographic and ABC News TODAY at 1pm ET. Register here: https://on.natgeo.com/3gWJHAj","It‚Äôs amazing how poorly understood Science and the scientific method is to the majority of US Citizens.Science is not instant, it‚Äôs not perfect and it changes as we learn more. THAT does not mean that there is a conspiracy or that there is ill-intent.We take an oath to ‚ÄúFirst, Do No Harm‚Äù.‚Ä¶See More. Mari Machado yet they claim to be the 'bestest' nation in the world...hypocrisy at its finest.. It's not amazing, it's intentional. Unfortunately, American's are distracted by the clown in office to realize a 6x bankrupted con man, with over 35k lawsuits pending against him for cheating blue collar workers, over 40+ sexual accusations against h‚Ä¶See More. very true Mari. As early as when I was in college, people still respected scientists and admired the highly educated, and WANTED TO BE EDUCATED THEMSELVES. What the f*ck happened? Nowadays people are experts in their own minds after watching a 3 minute YouTube video....and slamming experts with decades of learning and hard work behind them, like Dr Fauci. It's sad, scary, and frustrating.. So Fauci took that oath too? Doesn‚Äôt look like it. Had no idea so many science illiterate conservatives followed Nat Geo...ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è. Derek Donnell , herd immunity.  See we believe in real science not the BS you say will work. But keep trying. Robert D Clarkson may I ask what university your degree in virology is from?. Colin Babb 100% a bot. Robert D Clarkson believe? Science is the oposite of beliefs. Follow evidence where they lead and not ignoring them in order to support what you want things to be. There is no beliefs in science, we follow evidences. And you swallow youtube stupidity.. The science illiterate are the ones believing the numbers right out the gate...and it's not the conservative.. Derek Donnell laughing at paralyzed children says a lot about your character. I have been following the bill gates foundation for almost a decade. He has committed crimes against humanity. He deserves to burn in hell for the pain and suffering he has caused. Wake up!. Amy Halligan Let me guess.... Trump U. grad?. I had an inkling. NatGeo comment fields are always... interesting.. Derek Donnell And how many did they innoculate?. Let me guess, you believe men have periods too don't you...yay science. Look at the numbers instead of opinion pieces.. Derek Donnell I was just thinking the same thing. And the views are staggeringly paranoid and illogical.. Amy Halligan, and the League of Stupid Women.. Here you go with trying to link conservatism with illiteracy as well as ability to perceive when the govt is bullshitting you.. Patrick Anwandter what no retort? Yeah that's what I thought - typical cowardice from a gaslighting astroturfing shill. Derek Donnell I actually agree with Alex here since many think Science only happens in school and not in real life, so they refuse to accept what's happening.. Robert D Clarkson 50 to 83% population infection to reach the herd immunity threshold for Covid19.. Derek Donnell They think the follow makes them vicariously knowledgeable and scientific while not even understanding the words I just typed.. Amy Halligan. Derek Donnell says a liberal who believes everything he‚Äôs told.. Charley Thomas charley you really don‚Äôt know how to think do you. Derek Donnell That's presuming that these comments are by actual human being and not right-mongering bots.. Peter Lasorte  Oh really. That‚Äôs the comment you came back with? Okay Karen. You seem to have the erroneous belief that your ridiculous views amount to something. When in fact they are the feeble musing of a halfwit. Actually that‚Äôs giving you way too much credit. They musing of a product of a sibling union. Have a splendid day. You are a very disappointing. Bet all the girls tell you that.. They seek out things to make themselves angry.  Self-triggering. Derek Donnell they have no lives. Robert Tegarden he went to TrumpU. Peter Lasorte listen  Karen, have you read the Lancet paper re HCQ or are you focusing on articles that support your confirmation bias?. It seems lately that the scientist and mainstream media have been setting the science bar pretty low. I remember a time when it took time to develop a knowledge base for the science. Now the fad'science changes almost daily.. Pavel San-Martinek well I would hope no independent research on a new virus was done the last few years. And again you cannot cook results the same twice. Outside influences change the results, so peer review would make the result invalid.. Tyson Zufelt i do hope the same. At this point, despite I do not believe conspiracies, don‚Äôt know until what point the sides are right or wrong. I guess we will have to wait and see what is next.. Paul Fortier scientific information changes constantly. Love the laugh reactions. Haha, one of the most brilliant scientists in the world who is just trying to do his job. That‚Äôs funny.. Yep, Suzi- you fit the bill.. Stay mad about a laugh emoji Emily EcclesüòÜ Sensitive much honey? üòÜüòò?Have a fear filled day.üòò. Suzi Wheatley is a charming example of what's wrong in America today.. Except he's not though.  Even his own words.. Suzi Wheatley except she isn‚Äôt mad. You seem triggered though. Go lick some doorknobs and toilet seats and show us how brave you are.. Suzi Wheatley what gave you the impression she is mad? No angry emojis as opposed to all of your childish emojis which merely show that you can‚Äôt even construct a decent sentence, let alone have a grown-up conversation. But really, what‚Äôs so funny about a scientist?. Emily Eccles just ignore the morons.. Jadine Sayer and people aren't dying at the rate 'science said humans would' by touching the front of our masks, then touching other stuff that other people who touch the front of their mask go to touch.  If people would really watch what others do you'd never leave your house and have others bring germs to you!. We have learned this guy has changed his mind on every turn. Just like the weather channel they will be more than happy to look out the window to tell you if it's raining.'. Lynette Simonson Knudsen I am not a fan of Impeached Donald trump, but he didn't tell people to drink bleach. He implied bleach kills the virus (which it does).. Lynette Simonson Knudsen Sorry, where did I become a science denier for slating people who don't adapt to evidence?. James R Woodhead science denier much?? Better to drink bleach then?üòâ. Tyson Zufelt Really. Science the first admission was there was no way mask would work at all. What science would change in order for you to do an about face on that. My year of qualitative and quantitative analysis was not a waste.. Kenny Drasen there‚Äôs this thing called Trial and Error. Lesson: Use common sense, believe in science rather in a megalomaniacs daily rantweets. Aditya Narayan , herd immunity.  Look it up. It works. Oh wait you can't spread fear with it like the left wants to do. And I see more hate and fear coming out of the left than the right. So you should actually use reL common sense these days.. Wow this is pointless.. Idiots like Robert D Clarkson haven't read a non fiction book on their own accord their entire life. They get their source of informstion from facebook articles and mainstream news. And then callnother people sheep while he baaaaaaaaaaaaaas all over Facebook. Just ignore them. No point. Johnny Mac sheep. Esca Jensen It's a Coronavirus and like any other of its kind it's not going to disappear nor is there a successful Vaccine due to the constant Mutations. I don't believe that we can hide from a virus at some point everyone will be infected.. Esca Jensen before you continue with your bias, one word... Switzerland.. Esca Jensen Glad you realize it. There's no cure for stupidity.. Wow..... I can't believe the amount of NEGATIVITY?! What is that all about? He is the good guy, who had and has to put up of a goverment that doesn't let him do his job..... Matthias Friedrich , this man doesn't know how to do his actual job. He is a fear mongering mouth piece for the liberal left.. Robert D Clarkson. Robert D Clarkson how is telling people to social distance and wear a mask for public safety ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù you‚Äôre smoking crack. Robert D Clarkson anti intellectualism is not an intelligent look.. Matthias Friedrich Funny! I‚Äôve never heard that before. üôÑ And it ‚Äòs my married name because I not a freak of nature or a pervert.. Neda Suhail saying masks aren't necessary is not a 'context.' Especially from one who is supposedly the expert.. Kevin Miller atta boy, Kev!. Kevin Miller That‚Äôs the stupidest comment I have seen. Did you finish school?. Rajesh Singh Did you ever start?. Matthias Friedrich lol... sorry! üòÇ. We all can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt caught on to what happening.. ...people were begging Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act so that we could have masks ; so that we could get ventilators and instead of helping out the United States in our time of need, he was telling people -> 'you don't need a mask, the virus is a hoax, go to work'. Thanks, everybody for responding.... I will make sure to never, ever comment on a post in Facebook ever again..... lol. Matthias Friedrich just some pathetic trump groupies having tantrums. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Johnny Mac he graduated from Facebook University. Michael Anthony I think you‚Äôre confusing Fauci with Trump üßê. Hahahahahahahahahaha Fran Tarantella. Johnny Mac yeah ok haha. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. We've learned not to trust this doctor.. Darrell Spurlock Jr.. Found the sheep who hasn't read a book since highschool. Who touts youtube videos, Facebook posts and memes as his information source. And thinks others are sheep LOL.. Dr. QuackNtrump gave us an economy just above the great depression  and 165,000 dead and models are predicting +200,000 dead by election day.  But somehow morons believe it's the fault of the medical professionals.  This would be hilarious if not for the death and suffering and 20 million unemployed Americans.. Apparently him and the rest of his trumpanzees that get their sources from youtube videos. Harry Thu a ‚ÄúMAGA Yell Loudly‚Äù graduate from the University of YouTube is a highly coveted achievement, in some circles!. Robert D Clarkson. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Randy Whetstine is he around anyone outside of his bubble? No this isn't him being hypocritical.. Brittany Golden youve said that everytime, is that all you can add to the conversation. Cassandra Mcdaniel think you mean 'without'. Cassandra Mcdaniel some brain you must have trusting Trumps opinion over the guy who is a million times more qualified.. Spreading fear is not something i see as medical , he should learn how to speak before talks to groups and tells us 'The message is DANGER' like a old gospel revival before the Revivalist releases a bag of snakes in the church and demands faith. I like NATGEO , i don't like people that spread fear.. Exactly what 'fear' are you referring to? He's been trying for months, as additional knowledge is gained, to have Americans, all Americans, protect themselves until a viable vaccine is distributed.. Snake Handling is not a good way to convince people in medicine. You mean like trump spreading fear every time he speaks.. He  knocks  HCQ  because  it  works  and  if  people  took  it  they  wouldn‚Äôt  need  Remdesivir,  which  he  has  a  stake  in. Lisa Flynn go for it what do you have to lose?, chances are you are asymptotic and it‚Äôs just a drug. And then you can tell everyone it saved your life. You sound like you know what‚Äôs going on or maybe a stable genius.. https:''www.euronews.com'...'large-global-study-suggests.... Ahhh.. the LA Times!  I feel better now.. Otro corrupto genocida y falso totalmente, s√≥lo busca el y la oms acabar hasta con un 90% a la poblaci√≥n, sigan idolatrandolos no la de borregos.. Lisa Flynn then he‚Äôs lying. Did he tell you that when you‚Äôre on this drug you have to go for what‚Äôs called a field vision test every six months to check for macular damage? Did he tell you that it can take up to 2 years for the drug to leave your body completely?. Your reasonable, reliable and accurate source for your statement is.....?. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Jadine Sayer I  don‚Äôt  need  it.  I  was  asking  in  case  I  did.  The  people  who  took  HCQ  early  had  almost  immediate relief.  One  of  them  was  fighting  two  types  of  cancer,  took  HCQ  on  a  friday Friday and  was  back  to  work  Monday.  If  you  have  faith  in  ventilators and  vaccines then  stick  with  it.  I  sincerely  hope  they  work  for  you.. The problem is the wrong information that we have from the beginning of this pandemic. The arrogance of the president and the loss souls of the scientific community. Just to please the miss information of the politicians. America proud of my country Spain. We are together in this and we are fighting to have a better way of life. With responsibility.. Wait for the introduction people this is a scientist explaining science and it‚Äôs not the long-haired dude with the ball hat on he‚Äôs just doing the introducing. National Geographic, where are the pictures we love? The indigenous societies we love to discover? The world beauty you show? Who wants a corrupt doctor in a magazine about nature? You suck!!!!!. Give Lisa her pitcher book! üòÇü§£üòÇ. Lisa Beth sniff sniff. Typos and auto correct happen. Im I getting graded on this? Lol. Benedikt Kuhn don‚Äôt be an asshole please. Lisa Beth in other articles, especially in the actual magazine.. Corrupt doctor......ignorant people....this is why we laugh at you. The good doctor, that would be a great idea for a tv show!. Russia isn't experiencing a second wave.Russia has developed a vaccine.Russia is sharing the vaccine with the  rest of the world.Be like Russia: talk less, act more.. What expertise does Bowser bring to the table re pandemics? NatGeo is disgracing itself by providing platform to partisan hacks and politicos. Sure way to lose readership.. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Carlos Daniel Do you know how to read? My comment questions choice of Bowser. Do some research if you don‚Äôt know who she is. And stop disgracing yourself by ad hominem attacks.. Rajesh Singh you're the one turning it into a political thing, Fauci never took any political side and never tried to turn any of this into politics. People like you are the problem, he's just trying to do what he did all his life, trying to help people.. That the entire government system is corrupt. Including the doctors hospitals any this man on your picture. Curious on how much stock you own in Moderna? So quick to rule out a Russian vaccine. The history of Moderna is an interesting read. Quite the investment company there. Inside trading, poor history of a drug that actually worked. Poor ethics. And majority back by the central bank.. Todd Murphy he Russian vaccine is rushed and not properly tested, they have not released any information come the first two rounds of testing, so yes he feels that it my not be a good vaccine, as you and everyone should. Because they can hurt you if th‚Ä¶See More. You will learn that your so called experts is the worst blunder in the history!. The very day after the elections, the virus is totally gone........ Ted Giannopoulos just from the US or from all the other countries?. Typical north american, thinks that the whole world spins around the US. derp derp derp derp, derp derp derp........ Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Mimi Cronin I don‚Äôt know... but I do care for America,. Ted Giannopoulos Exactly. You don't know. But you're more than willing to present your poorly-formed opinion as fact.. ABC and national geographic, is main stream media not experts. How is the mayor of D.C an expert tooü§î. All l know is that pandemics are not new. Humanity have witnessed periodic outbreaks of epidemics and pandemics since the dawn of time. Mankind has endured & we have had huge strides in terms of prevention, scientific advancement, sanitation, treatment and vaccination.. Looking forward to it!. Science is about changes and how we should deal with them. So it's not about changing mind but adapting to what is.. We‚Äôve learned that evil politicians are so quick to politicize anything they see fit to try and destroy an opponent no matter how negative it‚Äôs effects are on the American people.. That we haven't learned anything.. This is ridiculous. Extinction is the only way to stop pandemics. Every species has them, and will until their all dead. Stop treating medicine like magic. Embrace the population reduction.. Stephanie Sarah ok first the world will not be flooded like 'water world' if all the ice shells melt, second the last one in Canada just fell, not the last one in the world. Third if we stay on earth eventually we would be fucked because the sun will e‚Ä¶See More. Tyson Zufelt the earth is way over populated. We dont have a chance. The last ice shelf just fell. You better buy a boat.. Stephanie Sarah the world is no where near overpopulated what a stupid statement. To most, science is just an opinion. And money can buy opinions.. You lost me with the inclusion of Bowser...........seriously???. Conservatives are going to come out the closet for this one & demonstrate their inability to function on planet earth.. Andres Ruiz , death cult????? Your mind is so warped. Fine wear your mask. I won't. I'll be the one that will see the finish line.. Robert D Clarkson bc wearing a mask is difficult rocket science. Anti-Maskers are in bed with neo Nazis & there is hardly any difference between the two so yeah you are brutally racist redneck scholar.. I wasn't too far off there was I?. Andres Ruiz you must be joking? Masks? Really? I‚Äôve seen hundreds and hundreds of them without masks.. do some research into who funded the wuhan lab. Kellie Dibble. I guess those who posted the haha emoji are know-it-alls or get their info from their cousin who works as assistand hairdresser in East Shrewhampton... Kelly Sweeney I hearted her comment and everything lmao. Shakeela Ameera I am not sure I understand but whether we like it or not science is science. We like it when the doctors save our lives don't we? We like it when science makes our lives comfortable. But we do not like it when it urges us to be responsible citizens.. Love the doctor death picture, its a classic. üíÄ. Why are we afraid of a virus that‚Äôs less deadly than the flu?. Natgeo not classy now, you sold your soul?. Russia Vaccine isn't going to work for Fauci either..   He has nothing invested in that group.... The last RNA vaccine we tried killed so many people we stopped trying.. I bet he's not first in line for it.... Great! A former CEO of Moderna and one of the funders was Epstein. NatGeo is losing the plot. Piss off Disney.

So.. gyms are opened back up... malls... grocery stores... parks... lakes... trails... restaurants... bars...yet movie theaters havent been opened back up yet??? Youd think it would be much easier to control the amount of people per theater room... I just want movie theaters to open back up already! üò≠üò≠üò≠,"I can see movie theaters being opened but the seats would be hard to disinfect. The issue is the duration. People are sitting in the same spot in a movie theater with questionable ventilation for much much longer than any other activity you listed.. I think this was somewhat of a choice and not many movies.  I heard they were going to open up but old movies. Also, I think drive-ins should be a thing again!!. Melissa Eide Hammerstrom I mean there‚Äôs a lot of parks that do movies throughout the summer. Taylor, I've heard of a few places... I think there should be more, and have them not go away. I think it's such a fun outing for families. Melissa Eide Hammerstrom Marymoor park is showing The Princess Bride Monday the 17th at 8:15 PM. AMC did announce 100 theaters opening. AMC opens the 20th. Wearing masks i mess eating or drinking. Limiting seating. Cassie Crane Braegger I'm with your husband lol. I love  AMC Wednesday where its half off... BIG FAN... I've felt so lost with out my movie nights! Its was my 'me day'. I'm stoked ü§£ü§£ü§£. And that buttery popcorn and coca cola freezes!!! Lol. Maralyn Akiyama oh really?  Dang why send the damn e mail and get my hopes up. Cassie Crane Braegger i know. If you have the AMC app. The email says they will 'start to open'. Click on 'find your state' ... Washington says 'will reopen when local guidelines allow'. Let's hope we can keep our virus numbers down so we can reopen before daylight savings time ends!. Melissa Eide Hammerstrom if you want I can send you the invite I saw on FB. Julia McIntyre I'm out of town, but thanks üòÅ. How dare you!  Don't you realize Covid kills anyone who enters a movie theater!?!We'll, except if they are burning it down in the name of 'protest'.  They are good.‚Ä¶See More. They are working on getting them open within the next week or two!!!!!!. Bars are open? Since when?. Olivia Glover the 10 PM rule JUST started a bit ago. Before that it wad back to normal hours lol. Olivia Glover they‚Äôve been open since June.  Things have scaled back again but it‚Äôs been a while. Katie Lynn Sandlin wow! I had no idea!. Olivia Glover if they also serve food then yes. If they do not serve food then they are closed. You have to be able to order chips or a sandwich or something.. I WANT POPCORN DAMNIT. Hope Fox mmmeeee tooooo..... I go sometimes JUST to buy a Bucket. Lol. Katie Lynn Sandlin yes! They should have it set up so if you want to just buy popcorn and leave you can lol. I do too, Katie!!! lol Great minds üòÅü§£. Omg I was just saying this to Scott! I need a movie with extra butter popcorn!!. I hear ya! We own a little taekwondo school in Burien and we can‚Äôt open ya do quarter of our business but you go to Walmart'Home Depot' Lowe‚Äôs or any other facility and is packed and there is no guarantee of any sanitation! üò°. Jesenia Rowe makes me so angry!!!. Angela Lambert totally! It will be so easy to sanitize the theater in between each movies, they already have to sweep üßπ and clean anyways but oh no they won‚Äôt allow it, we just need some sanity!. https:''www.cnn.com'...'amc-reopening-ticket...'index.html. Eva Hess Ha, just saw this. Pretty cool, huh?. Bummed cause I was looking forward to the new TopGun movie! üò•. Patrick, I was too!  Maybe we can suggest they show it outdoors in a drive in theater style with everyone in their own cars!. Regal is opening in a week :) https:''www.regmovies.com'...'en'us'regal-reopening-movies. They need to open the school's. AMC theaters will be doing 15 cent movies when they reopen. I‚Äôm not going back until there‚Äôs a Covid vaccine or it ‚Äúmagically goes away‚Äù as Trump promised. But I really miss it! https:''www.cbsnews.com'...'amc-movie-theaters-15-cent...'. First world problems... Angela Shira sure is. Theaters are open here in Long Beach!. They can open at 25% capacity, but at that capacity its not cost effective to open so many are choosing not to. Theaters run on thin margins anyway so its cheaper to just burn the cost of land'etc than open and pay for the movie play rights, electricity, labor and taxes'insurance for max 25% capacity.. Jean Ruff Nelson yep!. Angela Shira kick my feet up and have a few adult beverages. Wondering if this is because they either need to open no movie theaters or all movie theaters across the country because new movies wouldn‚Äôt want to release if not everyone could see it. If that makes sense? Plus they look at the number of people who w‚Ä¶See More. Rebekah Olson I understand what she meant. But like the previous person stated its not $$ for the theaters. Plus nothing new has come out. Angela Shira that‚Äôs why I said old classics. If they were to play the little mermaid, for example, it would be fun for a family to get out of the house, get popcorn'candy and watch a movie at a theater with reclining seats, etc. concessions are where the theater make most of their money anyway.

Can people safely go out and vote in person this year? Hear from Dr. Fauci and watch the full conversation here: https://on.natgeo.com/2POGNlp,"Yes. If I can go to the grocery, I can go to a polling station. Voting is an ‚Äúessential business.‚Äù And mail-in ballots should be available to ANYONE who is unable or afraid to vote in person. No reason all options can‚Äôt be on the table. My main concern‚Ä¶See More. Yes. Paula L Speight Everyone should be able to vote üó≥. Alexandra Bam Luke I will vote absentee because I can't go to poll.  I am concerned about not having volunteers to work.

I know he doesn‚Äôt like the mail in vote ( fraud all over) but by all means, vote!! For whoever! But vote!. I can safely go to Walmart so I can be just as safe going to vote. And I shall.. James Ferrell Cain I‚Äôll be voting by mail.  Not for tRump!. Taylor Jared Bytendorp It shall be so.. James Ferrell Cain I‚Äôm not doing either one. Not wasting precious time on these trash ass parties. Screw em both.. James Ferrell Cain I am in utah one of the four states that allowes voting by mail (not just absentee ballot).

You can go to Walmart or you can stay safe. You can not do both.. James Ferrell Cain I am happy for you.  I have had to vote absentee for many years and miss going places.. we here in Canada have been doing that for months, Canada Proud, eh, and please wear your masks.. Vote in person only with a photo I.D. The only fair way given the political atmosphere we live in at this point in time.. Why take a chance when you have the mail in option. If you can receive drivers license, passports, home deeds, voter registration ,immigration documents etc., you can surly vote for a simple election.. Most can go out to vote!! Figure a safe and valid way for those that can‚Äôt. why doesn't Fauci go home and social distance so this whole thing can be over. Although I prefer to mail in my vote, I am planning to vote in person because I do not trust the suppression of my vote by a person that is making the post office slow the mail on purpose.  However, mail in voting is necessary for people that suffer from cancer and other ailments that keep them tied to a wheelchair or at home because their immune system is compromised.. Can crowds safely go out and protest, gotcha.... If it‚Äôs okay to go to Walmart, you can vote in person‚ÄºÔ∏è. 2 problems.

Kelly Dossman easy to know who said it...it's also true, and what the men in power have done in this country since it's Inception.... Nobody, of course, is 'pitting' minority groups against each other. And the lawsuit is sound -- Yale indeed does discriminate against whites and Asians, and in favor of far less qualified blacks. Far from being the negation of the affirmative action mentality, the university's policy is the very essence of it.. It stands to reason that1) Students who were already admitted, have little to complain about in terms of admissions;‚Ä¶See More. Benjamin Fan 'admissions seemed fair to me' says the guy who got admitted.I don't know enough to form an opinion on Yale's admissions, so I'll leave it at that..

Many many more are rejected than accepted and I would argue that‚Äôs why the study concludes that Yale discriminates.  This Article focuses on those who dispute the study‚Äôs findings.  That‚Äôs why the quotes are from accepted students only.  Gonna be difficult to get a valid conclusion.  That‚Äôs my point.. Benjamin Fan Students have no issues criticizing their institution while there. I've spent 18 years on campuses as student and employee.. Benjamin Fan They aren't going to to criticize who admitted them into one of the hardest places to get in to...you wouldn't think ü§î. Stands to reason that, having 20% of Asians vs 5% black students seems disproportionated for an American school since the country is comprised of  ~15% black people and 5% ~ Asians. Jorge Andres Ramirez Many of these are not even citizens, having bought millionaires visas to send their kids to American colleges. Trump is selling the condos and visas.. Jorge Andres Ramirez  what about sports scholarship ?? Why is 15% black taking almost 100% in basketball and football scholarship?? ü§î Well! best of the best or let‚Äôs start granting sports scholarship to all average fat kids based on population?.  I think the article was rushed, not up to usual NYTimes standards, in its zealousness to prove a point. A more thorough article would make a greater attempt to interview both existing Yale students and rejected students and compare and contrast their attitudes, not just the plaintiffs.

Because the DOJ failed their suit against Harvard, they're going after Yale.  Obviously, they want the issue before the Supreme Court.  Pathetic.. So the students who made the cut dont care about others who didnt make the cut, solely because they were discriminated against.. Yup.  Gee, a Yale student does not want to say publicly that the school discriminates.  Meanwhile, Yale & Harvard run quotas. not how it works-they think that they are better not luckier -but they are a number of individuals I guess each feels/thinks about this differently. Not all cultures put an equal emphasis on education. Therein lies the problem, possibly.... Just drag the proceedings out to January and then Poof! they will disappear along with Barr.. I really want to have this conversation, starting with legacy admissions.. Yale had better prepare to write a yuuuge settlement check. The administration unlawfully discriminated against Asians and Whites!. Stands to reason that the Barr ‚ÄúJustice Department‚Äù which saw nothing wrong with dismissing charges against Flynn would want to cause division wherever it can.. The FBI's own memo's show that Flynn never 'lied', and now it is also known that the FBI threatened to go after members of Flynn's family on bogus charges if he didn't plead 'guilty.' It's called 'prosecutorial misconduct' ---and the charges against Flynn needed to be dropped for the sake of justice.. Michael Froebe don‚Äôt you mean biggley rather than big-huge.

,"My mother passed away earlier this year and the health department called me to let me know they had tested her to rule out the possibility of covid.

Where are you getting that info?. Diane It isn‚Äôt. This person is trolling and/or spreading misinformation.. Cari Page actually , you are wrong . I hear it first hand from nurses and doctors .. Natallia Fairchild Cari Page is a nurse. And when a person dies there is more than 1 space on the death certificate so yes they could die from complications of Covid.. Jackie Roemish we would have exponentially more deaths if that was the case üôÑ. Jackie Roemish there are roughly (very rough estimate) 7,000 deaths per day in the US from various causes. Today is day 227 of the year meaning there have been about 1.5 million deaths in the US from any cause. If all deaths are considered covid related then why isn't the death toll for Covid in the US 1.5 million?. Shelly Marie Dollar Witt it wasnt on this thread but I believe it's on this post-  a woman named tonya share a pic of someone with leg issues and then it says covid related- that's a bit alarming you would think if a death had absolutely nothing to do with covid, then they wouldn't put covid, but I guess not. ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è. Amanda Foy I completely agree with you. I think this happens ALL the time!!  Just like the guy who died from a car crash and was tested later to have it. They said he died from COVID.. Terri Marie I thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake.. Terri Marie I thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake.. Big difference between the words 'With' and 'Of'. IE, He died with Rona not of.. Plus hearing of false 'positives'; the post death test could be one of those.. No one dies from heart attacks or cancer anymore. Tony DeVore Exactly.. We know of a young man who scheduled a test, 2 week's prior to having a SX. Schedules changed, so he didn't show up for the test due to canceling the SX & 2 week's later, he received a letter in three mail telling him that his 'test' came back positive .

Please stop this shit!!! It was terrible to watch and the family still is going through hell. That is how they are keeping control.. Yeah because hospitals get tax kick backs for how many covid cases they deal with so they catagorize as much as they can accordingly. Seth Linde  Which drives numbers up, which feeds panic. The medical system is corrupt through and through but they are not necessarily being diabolical in this case. Hospitals are literally hemoraging money because they cannot perform the elective and ‚Ä¶See More. I can speak from experience... when someone dies, the king county health department (coroner) tests and has been testing everyone for the ‚ÄòRona. Everyone... hence why a gunshot victim or 3 (known) were labeled as Covid deaths even tho they were killed by bullets. Jashawa Scotch yep, even if they are on hospice for any other reason. Maybe we need to compare death rates in the US from 2019 to 2020 to put things in better perspective.

Ric OteroTo be fair: those dated rules you mentioned haven't actually gone anywhere. Going for a moderate candidate may not have been the best move here. We won't win over any Trump supporters no matter how much we try to compromise with them.. Valerie, sad but true.  Biden offers nothing but 'not Trump.'. Excuse me, but the GOP is running on the exact same platform they used in 2016. Trump is recycling his smear tactic of questioning a candidate's eligibility because of their citizenship. He's still crying 'But her emails!'  He's living in the past with no new plans for the next four years. No one is interested in reruns of his bad four year reality show.. Jason Seow That‚Äôs not entirely true though. Some have figured it out and are not voting for him again. Follow @Trump_Regrets on twitter. It gives me a little bit of hope.. Ric Otero google ‚Äúhow to win a presidential election in the United States‚Äù.. Marc JBraunstein , togetherness is a huge word. It's simple in structure but, so very complicated in action.. Marc JBraunstein this ain't 2016. POLLS SHMOLES. I will only do my vote. Polls mean zip in this election war. There is too much postal chaos trump is initiating.. Shirley Fenile yeah since the last election, you can‚Äôt trust polls. Just yourself and to encourage every non-voter to register to vote!. Shirley Fenile This is going to sound nuts.   Drive or walk to a polling place, bring ID, wait in line, then vote.. David Rout I have mail in 30 yrs. No thx.. I am not sure a pbs/npr poll is a true representation of the American people.  I want Biden to win but I'm not gonna be blindsided like I was last election.  No complacency. Vote.. Oh, he does know the difference,  just prefers to go along with rhe one who speaks what he thinks.. Agree with you on the need to avoid complacency, BUT please study up a little on how polling works. Reputable organizations *sponsor* polls, but don't have anything to do with how they're conducted. NPR/PBS hired experts to do the actual poll. There ar‚Ä¶See More. Don't want to sound like a broken record, but in 2016 all it took was a few 10,000s people in swing states to go 'meh, I'll vote 3rd party or write in to show 'em.' Please, for the sake of the world and the human race we cant afford tantrums like that.. Kelvin Ng well maybe ur party should stop putting forward trash candidates. Ross Caudill just keep laugh reacting my comments bc you have nothing valid to say. We see right through your laugh reacts.. Frank Baker Dempsey trash candidates? Let‚Äôs talk about Trump. I‚Äôm down for more party recognition and support, but not this election....a ramp up in 3rd Party or Independent support this election is a guaranteed win for Trump.  One goal....get Trump out of the White House, and then let 2024 be a free for all election.. Nick Cavaioli There's no need for or else, because we are already there.. Your right Trump 2020. Kelvin Ng it took a lot more people voting for a DC outsider con man because the Dem choice didnt campaign hard in swing states.. Millie Cox That is false. It will be a vote for whom ever I voted for. Hilary lost because she insulted Democrats and didn‚Äôt try to win them over after the primary. She didn‚Äôt inspire people. I voted for her because she wasn‚Äôt Trump, but I didn‚Äôt want ‚Ä¶See More. Kelvin Ng truth, brother. Truth.. Billy Flynn in prison!. Biden is a republican with dementia.. That's why Trump hired kanye with tax payers money. Piss. Off. We have the right NOT to vote for trash candidates. Neither of these candidates represent what I want. 3rd party candidates should be allowed on the debate stages. The Left says a 3rd party vote takes a vote away from Biden; the Right says it takes away a vote from Trump. I'm not going to hold my nose and vote for someone.. Jamison Normand nope vote blue-Biden or you have voted for Trump. Ross Caudill screw you & your petty tantrum. Kelvin Ng and my fear is that's exactly what inexperienced, fed-up, newbie under-20's voters will do by voting for Kanye.. Kelvin Ng - Agreed. In 2016 Clinton had a 10 point lead; look what happened.. Kelvin Ng ‚Äúvote for my party or else‚Äù isn‚Äôt democracy, bro. I don't recall that Biden's campaign seemed 'all but over' 6 months ago.  It is just so important that he is elected...we must continue to support him and work to get everyone out to vote for him.. If he loses its his own fault and the Democratic party's fault. His record is horrible. Im sure 100+ million people will not vote for the presidency. Lois Widener Alworth don't be a libtard.  biden will lose.  Or do you want your grandchildren to suffer the same fate as Cannon in a democrapic run country with criminals running rampant and the police non-existent?. Lois Widener Alworth Right. Biden was the top candidate before he even announced he was running.. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt long and rocky lol. The dnc establishment paved his way for drug him along. It‚Äôs fine. Better than trump.. Adam Campbell you‚Äôre right about the first part. The second part is up for debate. It's very motivational, inspirational, and a lesson for our kids to never give up. That even if you are politician who has spent nearly 50 years in Washington DC and has written legislation that protects big banks over ordinary citizens and crime bills that cause an explosion of incarceration rates for non violent offenses, you are never too old or too senile to become President.. James Sohr - grow up!  If you are for Trump vote for him.  Stop with the obfuscation of your intent will irrelevant comparisons.. Damon Fehler Ah, yes. If you believe that there were other candidates who were far more qualified than Joe Biden you must be a Donald Trump supporter.'If you don't vote for Joe Biden, you ain't a Progressive'. Clarence Walker You‚Äôre right. He should be blaming Mitch McConnell, since he‚Äôs sitting on over 400 bills passed by the House. Also, McConnell is responsible for not removing Trump from office during impeachment. Mitt Romney is the ONLY Republican with a shred of real decency and patriotism.. James Sohr he‚Äôs been in office for over 50 years? And he blames trump cause nothing gets done? What‚Äôs wrong with that picture. Grace Colf they both are, that‚Äôs the joke.. You too can be a pedophile and run for president of the USA (or even be the president!). Jack S Wolfie , trump did that!. He got there by mainstream democrats, not on his own platform. There is nothing inspirational about him.. There is plenty for me. He is not a crazy fascist. That is very important.. Zach Tiemann. Zach Tiemann ‚Äúnot Trump‚Äù is enough for me right now.. At this point any Democrat candidate would have had at least a 11 point lead.. Dave Koltes You can hope, but Joe has been... uniquely steady and reassuring here. He's a known, decent quantity. That might not be the case with other Dems who are more easily demonized.. He‚Äôs a horrible pick for the Dems.  So many more qualified  people out there than this lifetime, career politician.  I‚Äôm embarrassed for the Democratic Party.. Casie McCall Clayton How's he fighting? All he does in whine about how no one likes him and how unfair everything is to him. Trump is a weak joke that has weakened America.. Kim Nickells , he renamed the PRU and moved it to another department.  He was called names for starting the travel ban!  It‚Äôs a pandemic, caused by China.. Casie McCall Clayton I think both parties are actively trying to lower the bar. The next round will have a better candidate than the incumbent for the next few generations.. Wayne Wilkinson - did you think of that all by yourself?  Good job!. Casie McCall Clayton you sound ridiculous too.. Casie McCall Clayton yeah he's a businessman all right. Did you remember how he managed to bankrupt his casinos and frauded students at his university? Or the numerous reports of how he underpaid or didn't pay his workers?He's a businessman all right. Doesn't mean he's a good one, or a good president.. Talk about horrible picks, who would have thought a former game show host and failed business man would have been such a horrible failure as president? https://www.insider.com/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein.... Casie McCall Clayton you chose a known con man, with a history of racism, cheating, lying, filing multiple bankruptcies, who has been accused of/brags about unwanted sexual advances, who thinks the rules don‚Äôs apply to him...who was given a million dol‚Ä¶See More. Casie McCall Clayton fighting for America? Exactly how? Please put the koolaid down.. Casie McCall Clayton until there are term limits it will be that way.. Casie McCall Clayton THIS WAS ON A FRIEND‚ÄôS PAGE: An anguished question from a Trump supporter: ‚ÄòWhy do liberals think Trump supporters are stupid?‚ÄôTHE SERIOUS ANSWER: Here‚Äôs what the majority of anti-Trump voters honestly feel about Trump supporters en masse:‚Ä¶See More. Casie McCall Clayton you think?  You don't think that's your biggest problem.. Damon Fehler you were obviously dropped on your face... Casie McCall Clayton ...and f**k you too. Casie McCall Clayton Name just one economic indicator that has improved since trump took office.. He got to this point by the DNC being sketchy AF, but I guess if the old sang holds true, you can‚Äôt hate the player hate the game. Hope he wins or the world implodes 2020.. Zach Miller are we upset? I‚Äôm wonder how the pussy grabbing, pornstar adulterous, reads like a 3rd grader, temper tantrum man child got into office when the majority of America voted for Hillary Clinton?!?. Why put the gang back in charge that lied to us all about the ACA. - real cost based healthcare reform was set back a decade +.  Just say no to Imperialist  Joe.‚Ä¶See More. Mitchell Fellows so what you really want is Trump again... because that's what voting for Kanye gets... my guess is you're voting for Trump and just being sarcastic... which... is oddly more respectable than actually voting for Kanye. Because someone in the middle of a mania episode of bi polar disorder is a good choice? Just wait until the depression part hits. I‚Äôm not bashing people with mental illness, but he really needs to stick to his meds. He goes off the super deep end without them. I feel sorry for him actually.. Mitchell Fellows Kanyeü§£ü§£. Mitchell Fellows How‚Äôs the weather in Moscow?. Mitchell Fellows God, people will never understand the aca as it really was and I'm tried off explaining it.. Rydell Downward Has the flooding hit Cengdu yet?. Forget the polls. Too many people (41.9%) relied on the polls in 2016 and here we are. Put on your masks, wear the comfy shoes, grab your umbrellas, be late for work, leave early from work...If you didn‚Äôt vote last time then address the reason why THIS TIME and please get out there and make sure your voice counts. ‚úÖüá∫üá∏. Jada Love-Loveless i sat it out in 2016 because both Hilary and Trump were garbage but this time i will do whatever it takes to vote for Biden!. Mike Galligan that cashier already had a better sense of morals..... Mike, I absolutely agree with you. üòÇüôåüèº. Jada Love-Loveless I am ABSOLUTELY certain with a little basic training your neighborhood food lion cashier could do better than 80% of Congress and the entire white house team.. Polls are so you can let your guard down, thinking your vote don't matter...BUT IT DOES MATTER, GO VOTE..FILL OUT THE ABSENTEE BALLOT REQUEST... RETURN BALLOT ASAP (BEST NOT TO TRUST USPS). Legal and fair voting locations will help, call, ask questions...No such thing as a stupid question!!!! ‚Ä¶See More. Rebecca Nave Cling Mail your ballots before November 9th!. Still ignoring the fact he is in severe cognitive decline?. David Rout Yeah. Plenty to blame on both sides historically and present. Many mistakes.. Yong Park .. Oh lord.. NPR has really sheltered you from reality my friend.. Yong Park Senate blocked Os picks.. David Helms no worse than Trump and more than likely far better relatively speaking.. David Helms yes they are.. That about balances out the Trumpublican/Putin voter obstruction, manipulation, fraud, obfuscation and divisive propaganda campaigns aimed ay Illigitemately stealing another election.  Vote like your life depends on it.  Joe is an honorable compassionate leader who will do his level best to steer the ship of state out of rocky waters.. That‚Äôs because President Obama talked every moderate that was beating him to drop out of the race. The fact that he only has an 11 point lead over Trump perfectly illustrates his ineptitude.. I don‚Äôt even want to know what the poll results are. 538 had Clinton winning by a huge margin right up until election night!. David Leblond That isn't true. 538 consistently warned in the weeks before the election that other media outlets were overestimating Clinton's chances, that the race was tighter than people thought, and that Trump had an electoral college advantage. They had Trump's odds of winning at three in ten which isn't exactly a rare thing.. Yup. 538 had Clinton up by 3.6 percent, and the actual margin was 2.1 percent -- well within all margins of error. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/. Paul Murray exactly it‚Äôs so tiresome this willful ignorance to misunderstand what polls are and mean. It also helps that he hasn‚Äôt had an unscripted interview since 2018.. aww look I hurt its feelings. JD Backberg 11/2017. Kevin Howlett https://youtu.be/JtvGR8UX1L0. And Trump's off script endless video, phone a fox & friend and tweets are proving he needs a padded room. Knock it off! We can see the difference.. David Rout The one who is cheating, again, is worse.. Biden's campaign lacks the energy.  Still hoping he'll win just because he's not Trump, the corrupt, con man who's just looking out for himself.. And if Biden loses they will once again blame everyone BUT themselves for nominating an awful candidate.  The only reason Biden has any chance at all in the general election is Trump.  Imagine how big a lead the Democrats would have if they hadn‚Äôt nominated a ‚Äútransitional president‚Äù.. Alex Gross I'm not a Biden fan, and would vote for a decent Republican over Biden....but I will NEVER give trump my vote... so, Biden it is!! As trump would say... 'what do I have to lose ?' We made it through 4 years of trump... we will survive 4 years of Biden!. Linda Deka My exact same thoughts and feelings!!!. I'll never believe polls again.  Many Trump supporters are too embarrassed to admit they are voting for him.  Vote like you're up against a wannabe dictator who is willing to cheat, cause we are.. Stephanie Striegel The shy or embarrassed Trump voter that doesn't show up in polls is a myth.. Hardy Trenda LaLa right. No one supporting Trump at this point is going to change their mind, but maybe there's enough undecided voters to make a difference.. Paul Murray it‚Äôs hard to imagine any Trump supporter staying silent.. Paul Murray glad to hear it.. Stephanie Striegel agreed!. You're right. Some people don't like trump but are still going to vote for him and they're keep their opinions to themselves. My question is, if you are too embarrassed to openly vote for someone, then why in the heck are you voting for them??. Sue Greenhause Thank you!!!. Vote for your favorite pedophile.  Doesn't matter if it's blue or red you will vote for a pedophile slaves.. Gail Cain me too...every day!  This is definitely the election of our lifetime!. Hardy Trenda LaLa it's funny because he hates everyone, but loves manipulating people to make them think he's our their side.. Stephanie Striegel I agree with you about not trusting polls, but I think it‚Äôs more likely people who voted for Trump before are more likely not to want to admit that and are are either voting for Biden, not voting for president at all, or writing someone in.. Gail Cain  goes both ways  I've family members who unfriended me because I don't share their liberal views.Not once did I tell them I was right  What made them mad is I didn't say they were right ‚Ä¶See More. This is funny. NPR/PBS does the poll? That‚Äôs not even close to being a non-partisan poll. Why not get the DNC to do the poll?. Tex Gill It's a Marsists poll which is a well respected independent polling company. You'd know that if you did even a smidge of research before commenting.. They're not just calling the people who send them money.  And actually PBS and NPR are not biased.. Clearly you don't understand how polling works. Look into it; it's interesting. Take an introductory measurement and statistics course. For senior citizens like you, they're usually free to audit at a state university or community college, and you don't have to meet the admissions requirements.. Paul Murray Besides Gallup is busy with a new girlfriend.Marist works harder and hasn‚Äôt had a date since 97‚Äô.. Rocky? He was handed the nomination.. LeaAndrea Johnson yes, handed as in won by several million votes. LeaAndrea Johnson the fix was in. The DNC did it last go round to Bernie too.. The voters picked Biden over Bernie; the ones who dropped out would have only diluted both their numbers and prolonged the primary. It was a smart tactical move, and tactical thinking is what we expect of political parties intent on winning elections.. Troy Carpenter So, it was the voters that dropped out and endorsed him a day or so before Super Tuesday?. Troy Carpenter so you agree, the party 'tactically' rigged the election üòÅ. Rocky road? As in ice cream, maybe. They handed him the nomination, despite several debate appearances that left most of us wondering why. A desperate move to stop the progressives. Perhaps they were right. Perhaps Biden will do better against Trump than Sanders would have done. But rocky road? Hardly.. Obama convinced the other candidates who were leading Biden to drop out to stop U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Ryan Cab exactly üëå. NPR reporters getting paid for full articles when the story is one sentence long. Ryan Cab are we reading the same thing? I think the title is referring to looking for Obama‚Äôs endorsement. I don‚Äôt see anything that Obama pressured candidates to drop out. Am I missing something here?. Michael Hollrigel https://www.nbcnews.com/.../looking-obama-s-hidden-hand...https://www.msn.com/.../did-obama-encourage.../ar-BB10LvDj‚Ä¶ See More. I hope the Biden campaign doesn‚Äôt get complacent.  The current President will lie, steal, and cheat to win.. Matt Marano & even if he does win we must insist there was lying, cheating and stealing.. Matt Marano He‚Äôs already lying, cheating and stealing!. Matt Marano Biden and his son set a great standard üòÇ. Alana Bowdridge please try harder.. A shanfully DNC trick to kick out Bernie. Antenor Martin Aleman Ramirez are you saying that Bernie did not pull out of his own choice?. No time to be complacent. There are those debates and the issue of turnout. It is a long time yet and the dangerous part for Biden begins now.. Do not become complacent!  We need every single vote.  We need a Blue Tsunami to let the criminals know they're through.. Biden and the DNC don't. Wayne Wilkinson Your profile indicates that you drink a lot.  That probably explains it.. The DNC screwed Bernie Sanders (again) and handed the nomination to the much inferior candidate Biden.. Everyone else dropped out the night before Super Tuesday - not a very long story üôÑ. Kailee Bringedahl Great choreography. Nothing is the same about 2016 bro. Bro please! It's a different election! Hillary wasn't polling as well back then, bro. You gotta vote blue no matter who, bro... please. The Democratic establishment isn't flagrantly ignoring and diminishing the voices of the left and youth once again. It's a different election! Bro please!. You just gotta try a different, more conservative and pro-corporate strain of politician, bro! Please!. Vote blue pedophile they are better than red pedophile.. Chris Finestone You should look into the electoral college. You seem to misunderstand how all this actually works. 'Joe Biden's long and rocky road to the Nursing Home' .. there, I fixed it for you.. General kindness? That‚Äôll get you pretty far, even in today‚Äôs hate tornado we‚Äôre all trying to survive.. Because the establishment said it would be Biden no matter how unenthusiastic majority of voters where about him.  Progressives knew this before it even started, it wasn't our first rodeo with the DNC.  After Bernie took the early lead in the first few‚Ä¶See More. Hope you are going to vote Blue!. Josh Christopher rIgGeD. Bryce Evans thank you for that.. sure I agree with that. Josh Christopher, can't LOSE to the worst candidate in history if you ARE the worst candidate in history. LMFAO. Keep drinking that Kool-Aid - he is the same exact position Clinton was in at the same point in 2016.. This isn't about me in a nice safe coastal state.  https://www.rollingstone.com/.../democrats-will-learn.../. Ian Thomas Dooley huge difference here .. Ian Thomas Dooley Hillary isn't running.. Ian Thomas Dooley yes he is. He's a Republican light centrist that's never done much of anything good in his long career in politics.. Ian Thomas Dooley Incorrect. Trump was much closer to Clinton in 2016. Some polls even had him ahead. Also, Clinton had record-breaking disapproval ratings for a Dem candidate. More than 50%. Biden‚Äôs is less than 50%. ‚Ä¶See More. It doesn't matter, when election time comes, Trump will win. Biden would be a disaster to this county. Alex Lopez. Why do people put so much into polls?

That means they‚Äôre catching up!. Rachel Cecilia Great! My passport will expire in December. I need one for when this Pandemic mess has passed and we can travel again.. Iliahi Freaze get ahead of it, I sent mine in mid-May, 2 weeks before it expired. I just got my new one in the mail yesterday and I'm still waiting for the card version and my expired passport. There's definitely a delay.. Iliahi Freaze Yes. They warned us that there would be a delay, but there ended up not being one.. You need to work on your lineup, Atlantic: you're getting repetitious. Save your recycling for your plastics.. It won‚Äôt be like this forever. This gloom-and-doom isn‚Äôt helpful.. Thank you, President Trump!. Look on the bright side. We got the wall!

"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like a typical tornado,"" said one meteorologist. In this case, the National Weather Service reported ""a very large pyrocumulus and reports of fire tornadoes.""","Australia doesn't have tornadoes, we have cyclones (hurricanes). Last year, and again this year, we had the phenomena of fire tornadoes.  So much of our country was on fire, with record heatwaves, including many places that have never had bush fires in‚Ä¶See More. Cherilyn Carroll it was terrible, I still shudder thinking about it and am anxious about this summer. Cherilyn Carroll very sad, as it  killed many poor innocent animals.. üôèüèª California fires are all too frequent; so many acres of forests & homes are lost every year. The homeowners must dread the coming of summer every year. They really need our prayers& lots of help. I also feel bad for the firefighters.üôèüèªfor them too.. Catherine Madden Pray for them. Catherine Madden Thank you.Yes we do. It‚Äôs a constant source of stress along with earthquakes.üòñ. Catherine Madden prayers? Are you kidding? Climate real political movement yes ! Your president is the worst of all on these questions, and responsible for the aggravation of all this. Prayers are irresponsible people inefficient tools. Stop electing this kind of world killer please, we all suffer through the planet because of Americans inconsequent votes.. It's intensely hot across Northern California and we had a 2 hour long episode of high winds and dry lightning last night. Really does not bode well for preventing wildfires. There are several burning nearby our area now.. Emily Szasz I‚Äôm in Petaluma, north of SF, and we got tons of rain with our lightening that lasted from about 4:30-8AM ... grateful for the rain üíó. Emily Szasz ooh too bad to hear that. Horrible, really. The moment I read about the Heatwave, my concerns immediately were for the possibility of wildfires. And this does not bode well. Our thoughts are with everybody in this part of California as well as any who are without electricity there as well.. Bless the heroic firefighters!!! May God place a protective  blanket of grace over each and every one of them.. I live less than 10 miles from this fire in North Reno It is bad bad bad.  Smoke is terrible.We had evac orders yesterday but it was changed to an advisory. Hoping they get it under control soon.  Thank you firefighters.. ZeeShelly Galliher Preziosi That would be hard,chickens go everywhere. Im glad you have a safe place to go too.I will be thinking of you all and hope the fires get stopped soon.. Carol Edmonds  They set up the Reno Livestock Event Center to hold the large animals and livestock. My friend rounded up her chickens and brought them there yesterday but when the evac order was lifted she had to go pick them up today.  So, we have som‚Ä¶See More. Shelly Galliher Preziosi Omg, that must be so scary! Stay safe!. Shelly Galliher Preziosi , be safe. Shelly Galliher Preziosi Tis the season, Stay safe!. Shelly Galliher Preziosi stay safe. Shelly Galliher Preziosi Good luck, thinking of you and everyone in this area. Praying everything will be ok quickly. So very sorry this is happening.. Shelly Galliher Preziosi be safe üôèüèΩ. We drove past Reno yesterday and saw this! An entire mountain going up in smoke. So so sad.. We have to wake up!! Mother Nature is giving us a sneak preview of her majestical powers. Remember how she dealt with the dinosaurs!!!. No one remembers what happened to the dinosaurs. Everyone who was alive then is dead. Especially the dinosaurs.. It happened since 4:00 am until 11:00 am, the sound was terrible and some places has been affected.. Mili Trujillo-Principe what happened. So sad for Northern California.  here in Southern CA we are having fires, but these Fire Tornadoes are another level of danger. They had them in the Carr fire 2 years ago. Please keep them in your thoughts!. I remember hearing about them then.  Fires bi enough and intense enough to create their own weather systems.  So incredibly frightening!. We had them during Tubbs, too. While evacuating and I could barely stand up with the wind force. Cars flpped over.  It was like the world was ending.. Big love and strong safe vibes! Northern California is my home.. These events are not going away but will get much worse if we do not make changes to the way we live and treat our Earth. We must enact tough legislation to limit our carbon footprint.. Kathleen Anguera it has nothing to do with carbon footprint. Fire Tornados.2020 just keeps getting better and better.. JP Perry ~ Y20K is Y2K on steroids. And just think, there‚Äôs an election coming up!. J Thomas Gaffney Lol except the crazy stuff actually happens. JP Perry You‚Äôve noticed.. JP Perry Not 2020 enough-- we should throw in some spiders for good measure.. JP Perry Colorado is preparing for a tarantula migration.. JP Perry I can't. I'm done.. JP Perry   This year had it all: plague, hurricanes. Floods, Earthquakes, record high temperatures, volcanic eruptions , droughts,  locusts. Regular tornadoes, fire and now fire tornadoes and melting permafrost.Did I forget anything? Oh, and the appearance of Trump, the antichrist.. Kathy Kelley Explosions, you missed explosions.. Jennifer Ashley and murder hornets. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like a typical tornado‚Äùunderstatement of the century. hmm. Because this is 2020: of course there are fire tornadoes!. John Erdahl there already were, earlier in 2020. The year certainly started as it meant to continue.. John Erdahl 2020 very difficult. The problem will be when this kind of thing happens in the next future years, becoming something usual. John we also had fire tornadoes 2018 in CA. John Erdahl , I don't understand, elite me more. John Erdahl next there will be sharks.. John Erdahl As far as I recall back in 2018 everybody was hoping for a better 2019..then 2019 was crap and everybody was hoping 2020 would be betterü§Øü•µ. HOLY crap! wait till they Sharks are added in. Kidding aside this is awful. sympathies to the victims in this tragedy.. Gary Nix    That was my first thought too.. Yes we got them as new freak phenomenons in Australia in our killer 2020 firs season. Fire trucks were picked up and tossed through the air in these events. Mad wild and far far more frightening than Covid. This is the year where the marks of Global Warming are showing undeniably. 2020 is the year it is become clear. Vote only for the survival of the planet at this point in time everyone.. Under what president has California not had a wild fire . Time to cut some timber and underbrush if you want this to stop . They know how to control wildfires.. Larry Haffner The Federal, not State, government has control of most California woodlands. FYI. Larry Haffner a good raking should do it. Larry Haffner you want us to take the forest like Trump claimed? Yeah that‚Äôll fix it.. These fire tornadoes happened in Australia in January as well, killing fire-fighters. Just horrific. üò™. Sarah D'Astoli omg. Seems we gonna enjoy MARS weather sooner then scientists predicts ü§ó cool. Voj√≠n Davids not today bloodbag. Hopefully not üòî.

"In The New York Times Opinion Section  ""For all his klutziness and indiscretions, Biden‚Äôs overall message appeals to our better angels and hopes, while Trump‚Äôs appeals to our demons and fears,"" writes Jennifer Senior.","Biden is a great example of human decency combined with experience. Trump is running a crime syndicate in the White House.. Dave Garland you‚Äôve never heard of it because you live in a right wing echo chamber bubble, the way people who toss around the word lib as an insult tend to do. It‚Äôs why you‚Äôre so completely uninformed. The sooner you wake up to that fact, the sooner you‚Äôll wake up to reality..

Are you going to tell me that you have no relatives that have ever got hooked on something.  Even though he was on drugs, he got a law degree.  Biden taught his son a work ethic.. Kellene Neering OMG no point wasting my time on you!. Lydia Vanderwalker, you should re-read my post. I'm pointing out that having an addict in the family isn't a disqualification for being POTUS.. Bone spurs? What are you talking about . Biden‚Äôs son failed a drug test twice and was removed. Oh and Biden shouldn‚Äôt be president because he can‚Äôt complete a sentence . Maybe thirty years ago but he is also a molester and creep. He has been hanging around for 50 years and has done nothing what makes you Biden supporters think he has anything new?. Rita Dalessio so true!. Dave Garland  OMG!. MaryJanice Davidson what about the guy who got fired while he and his son waited. Dan Siegfried tRump has known for over 5 weeks that putin put bounties on your friends sons and daughters and did Nothing....if you support tRump you are a traitor by proxy!. Dave Cunningham oh there‚Äôs plenty there. It‚Äôs been swept under the rug. Rita Dalessio Sure, elect the best of two evils.. I did.  I attended his book signing  He spoke of his son, family but also of his political career. There was so much about him I didn‚Äôt know  this was before he was officially a candidate. I was extremely impressed and left thinking what a man of character and political accomplishments. 50 years in office and still we don't know what he stands for. ü§î. Jean Caton in all the years in government he has done nothing. Jean Caton what accomplishments?. Sheila Cassata sounds like you are describing Trump.. Jeffrey Eskew do your homework. Jean Caton  lol. Sheila Cassata. Byron Branyon  That sounds computer generated also.. Timothy Pueyo To me it just sounds like she knows how to write well.. He‚Äôs a good man.  I am fine with supporting him. He will restore competence and integrity to our government and clearly do a better job managing the pandemic.. Never accomplished anything worth while only for himself and his family. Made them rich.Talks a good talk.. I think he‚Äôs a great man! No person serving the public for 40 years plus is free from errors and bad policy decisions (no one is perfect including myself and you - Joe/ Jane Voter) but he is the President we need for this country if we want salvage whatever humanity we have left in the US.  #BidenHarris2020. She is right. When it comes to hard-knocking political issues like the coronavirus and the economy, Joe Biden will do anything to beat Trump in November. He cares about us. He has citizenship, respect and honesty for all of us. That is why I am happy to vote for Biden and Kamala.. Compassion, intelligence, experience, morals....so ready to get back to that after this destructive mess we‚Äôve been in.. Agree... there has been no guidance, humanity, Hope or decency for three years. It‚Äôs what has made us fighting angry with each other, made us feel hopeless and lost in this pandemic, and no empathy for those who have lost lives so that our world can‚Äôt recover. We have been made a house divided by conspiracy theories, namecalling, fear and veiled threats.. How many decades on the taxpayers' dime with little accomplishment, add in the accusations by Tara Reade which fell off the radar despite reassurances that 'all women should be believed' along with rapidly declining faculties...love him, don't vote for him. He's dedicated his life to public service and helping the common person. He has empathy and compassion for us. He cares about us. I am happy to vote for him and Kamala.. He is a decent, compassionate human being. He is intelligent enough to place the appropriate people in the right positions. Through his administration, the US can regain its position of respect in the world. We will move forward for the well being of the American people. Pretty simple..

Praying for people to stop embracing hate There‚Äôs a simple solution live and let live ,‚Ä¶See More. That‚Äôs how they want it, isn‚Äôt it? Not the police‚Äôs fault for your criminals, or terrorists. Bad people weren‚Äôt created by the police, so stop reflecting or making excuses. Bye Karen and Smollett.. All this is due to the Marxist BLM and nothing to do with police brutality..... They need to do something about these f****** people black lives matter terrorist group enough is enough loading Robin stealing and raping are country the Democrats are letting this happen and don't give a s*** they're destroying our country when are we going to get the help we need I need a fire them Democrats and use our paychecks to rebuild the cities and law enforcement. This is why we need to fight for our guns rights. People like this are dangerous. Freedom!. No wonder. The songs released by top rap artists from the music industry celebrates The Gangster Lifestyle. Violence, disrespecting women, hate police, drugs and crime. That‚Äôs the role model unfortunately.. Worst areas in Cincinnati. It isn't cops shooting anyone!. The Democrats are making everything worse!! They defunded the police!!! The Democrats are the party of hate and racism!!! They're putting innocent people lives in danger!!!!. Every city is major city is feeling the crime wave... it seems to be only getting worse... my city has multiple separate shootings a night now we‚Äôre much smaller than. Cinci.... Remember the panic when you couldn‚Äôt find toilet paper. Wait til you can‚Äôt find a police officer. Hate will help clean earth up in the long run.  The more people that go away from earth the better for the environment.. Wonder if those were all black on black since their lives matter so much to each other.. And not one person was shot by the police.  The police are backing down.  Be careful what you wish for !!. Social ills of having almost everyone with the gun with weak laws; the laws should be reviewed.. Wow!! We are so ‚ÄúGreat Again ‚Äú!! Doesn‚Äôt everyone want four more years of this?!!. Another uncontrollable city run by Democrats,  and they want to control the United states. COMING TO A CITY NEAR YOU.   PEOPLE get your head out of the sand, this will continue and effect every city and town,. It‚Äôs like hearing Mondays on which movie did the best in box office. But now it‚Äôs which city had the most shootings. Sad reality. Looks like social distancing and mask wearing are working out great. The sooner we can get #45 out of office, the sooner we can get back to normal!!!. Another good reason not to visit Chicago.. Wow. Cinci usually a pretty calm city Is this crap expanding If so someone needs to but a boot on the neck of this rebellion. Just a preview of more to come with the libtards supporting all of it by undermining our men/women in blue. The problem isn‚Äôt 45, it‚Äôs liberals raising children.  They are growing up now and don‚Äôt like hearing no, you can‚Äôt have this or that.  They are having tantrums because life hit square in the face and they don‚Äôt like having to earn their living.. I always said the good people  of theses citys. Should rise up with force and put the rollers on them  that kill and dedtroy..dont need them in your citys. Stand up people... Where are the community activist when you need them?. Nice job to all you Democrats in Cincinnati !. This is exactly why we need to defund the police #blm. Nothing good happens after midnight.  So much for quarantine...Or are these gangs ESSENTIAL?. Maybe if they wore a mask?. So if we look at historical records, violence, abortion, are the dnc policies intent on destroying blacks in America?. And how could a social worker handle this?! All this violence and murdering and the liberals want to cut police funding. If anything they need to increase it!. There you go.. keep voting for Democrats.. it's only going to get worse... Every neighborhood listed has a high rate of black on black crime and drug-infested. Thanks for the lack of details Fox.. This is what happens in democrat controlled cities. I tuned into WKRP in Cincinnati, less Nessman reporting that helicopters were flying over the city dropping frozen turkeys. Sounds like a big huge mess. Question is what distraction is this for? Chicago has this on a daily. This isn't LAW-ABIDING Gun Owners....these are criminals who have guns....BIG DEFFERENCE.. If it isn‚Äôt reported on WKRP I won‚Äôt believe it.. BLM is enroute to investigate.... That Defund the Police is really working ... huh left?. All you guys screaming about Democrats this and and Democrats did that need to quit crying and slap yourself. Where‚Äôs Kasich? Mr Fence Sitter.. Another democrat run city, can you say you are surprised at this?. Where is Snake Plissken when you need him?. Another beautiful night under democrat rule.. Black lives really matter, lmfao! The hypocrisy is hilarious at best.. Soooon what do any of these incidents have to do with George floyd and the moves to change policing? Or was that just thrown in there to fool the ideologues who wanted to hear about that stuff? Sounds like a poor attempt at manipulating public opinion with elementary propaganda.

More than 60 emergency calls to police went unheeded overnight in Portland as officers were preoccupied with hundreds of demonstrators downtown and were pelted by rocks.,"God bless that city‚Äôs law enforcement officers. They‚Äôve been put through the ringer now for months with no gratitude! üôè. Lori McArthur Brewer I don‚Äôt know how they take the abuse. I would have already been fired. People throwing rocks would get the right back.. Tina Davis a LOT of restraint, definitely. Thankless job. Lori McArthur Brewer. carrying out trumps race war!. Lori McArthur Brewer pretty sure beating up civilians is a clear indication they don‚Äôt have ANY restraint. This needs to stop now! We need our police. We can rid our police departments of the few bad cops. What we don‚Äôt need EVER are rioters and looters!. Patrice Davis Hoover time cull them. Shut up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1JZKZWSCu8. Patrice Davis Hoover not a few bad cops... let's start @ 50% bad 50% ok, let's start there and we can talk. These portland police officers are some of the toughest, most courageous people that I have ever seen. Theopolis comes to mind.. Like I‚Äôve said time & time again.....the city let the police down by making the federal agents leave.  If they would‚Äôve let them stay & take out the trash aka protesters, the police could do their regular job.  Unfortunately, the innocent people are being overlooked because of the incompetence of the city council!  Come on Oregonians WAKE UP!. The entire city should get together and sue the people that are letting this happen. That‚Äôs awesome and they still keep letting it happen. The stupidity of the left and liberals is through the roof and they will just keep voting them in. It will never get better until the ‚Äúright‚Äù gets involved. If they voted them they are getting what they deserve the Darwin effect is taking place.. If they ever loved that city, they need to re-elect the guy to start knocking some heads!  Right now his hands are tied.  At this point, I‚Äôm sure they find issue with the brand of toothpaste he uses!!!!  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Is this even a surprise? The residents of Portland deserve better than this. Those who voted in (and continue to support) the derelict mayor/officials of the city should realize you can‚Äôt have it both ways. You want to defund the police? Yet still call them the moment you realize you‚Äôve got no one else? Sickening. Way to go! Elected Officials are a Disgrace. Vote Red or this will be in every single city in the US. God Bless and Protect those who serve.üá∫üá∏. I live 2 hours south of Portland. Our govenor is useless and doesn't care. However, the rest of us have to make sure we have our masks on or face a $1,000 fine. Oregon is one of the worst places to live in the country. High taxes, high unemployment, terrible school system, housing costs are ridiculous, etc. etc. etc.. Hopefully Oregon will be waking up from this, and realize that voting blue has been destroying them. They will turn into a red state.. And yet the marxist leaders of this failed city claim that Federal officers were the problem. And what happened when they left? These rioters barricade a police building with people inside and tried to burn them alive. This isn't protesting, its viol‚Ä¶See More. This is why we MUST have gun rightsüëä Defensive measures are necessary, when the government you pay to protect you messes up their one job.... LMAO. People of Portland get what they tolerate. Feel free to recall your mayor and the rest of the city council. The ones in control aren't doing chit for law abiding citizens.. Hmmm....  Looks like Oregon has a real handle on serving the people who contact 911.  Nice going, Oregon.  I hope your residents remember you at the ballot box...  Karma..... They voted their local government in and now they need to pay the price.  Let‚Äôs see what happens in the next one.  No sympathies here.. The taxpayers in Portland deserve better if they really do need to quit voting Democrat. One of my friends used to call Oregon, God's Country. Well the devil has wrecked that.. Pride the citizens of this city will wise up and vote Republican. Can't have it both ways. Sorry for those that didn't want any of this. Get out and vote in Nov.. Portland has done this to itself. Decisions are not without consequences.. My heart goes out to the people of Portland put at risk by these protestors.  I hope that vote the crap out of that city.. Keep voting blue and your whole life will be unheeded ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Giving them no support, take away their defense and cut the budget what exactly did you expect to happen !. It must suck to live there , and I live in Chicago , so I feel and understand the pain of all this none sense ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. If any 911 call that couldn't be handled ends up with severe consequences, any one charged with rioting during that time should be charged with some degree of hindering aid.. Aren‚Äôt we defunding the police? What‚Äôs the problem? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Actions have consequences...voting for democrats for example.. all police should take a month of and leave the rioters to it.city council should respond with their social workers. Sadly, it's what Portlanders get for voting in libtards. And, keeping them. They can change it.. If I were the police union I‚Äôd be organizing a nationwide strike. Enough is enough.. That‚Äôs what they get for defunding the police. They deserve it because they voted for whoever in charge.. ‚ÄúGood luck with that‚Äù- Oregon State Police. It is an ongoing futile situation, because of inept liberal democrats taking their cues from the Washington D.C. inept liberal democrats.. Law abiding citizens need to ban together and run their mayor, DA and everyone else in charge out of town.. Did they send out unarmed social workers instead? üòÇ. Sorry Portland but you elected officials who won't stand up to rioters and anarchists. I don't feel bad for you at all. You voted for socialists and this is what you got. Have you learned anything yet?. Time for some water cannons!!!. Where is the Community Services Resource Strike Force Team?. That‚Äôs your future Portland unless you get your act together.. defund the police, so why should they respond???. Stand with Trump and take our country back!!!!. The beautiful PNW city Portland destroyed by the left. Very sad.. Hopefully the people of Oregon will wake up.. Portland, one of the first cities to fall.. Cops should stage a walk out and sit back and watch the city burn. Then pull all federal money out of the state and tell‚Äôem good luck.. Go Bill Barr!!! They messed up for disrespecting you the way they did in that hearing. Pain coming.. Have the people of Portland learned their lesson for electing democrats?. Wonder how those people of the 60 emergency calls to 911 now feel about defunding the police  and their citiy leaders.. This is a shameful disgrace.

Amanda Williams It is the city's responsibility to pay for the damage when they don't support the police and officers that would've stopped this. Since the mayor told police to stand down, who should've stopped this?. Right.  We have to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù towards our fellow man by wearing a mask and distancing, at the SAME time people are attacking others and their businesses.. Kathleen Ziska Terlizzi its a must for us to do so.But here in Africa we dont take this virus serious. Sue the city big time! That is the only way things will change--if it hits the city money wise.  Go for it, get a huge settlement.. Yes please! Sue the city big time for allowing this to happen! (Breach of duty by these so-called leaders) These people are trying to work and survive... Stealing is stealing! No excuse!. The city will probably charge the shop owner for having glass on the sidewalk. That's what they did in minneapolis..charged a business burned to the ground $3k for a fence the city out up around the rubble. So much lawlessness, we need to stop defunding law enforcement!. This was not stopped by the mayor or govenor. Time for everyone to take a stand in all that they have worked so hard for. However it will take a long time since nothing was done in the beginning when it should have.. Good. I hope they all sue. It's a breach of duty by these so-called leaders and they need to be held accountable!. More business owners and people who have had their property destroyed or threatened should sue the city and the state,.. ALL the business owners should sue that mayor! And it should happen in every city that has had looting & destruction.. Good , they allowed this to happen . You have a right as an American citizen to be protected. Absolutely correct to sue the city.  The mayor is shameful.. 2nd Amendment should take care of that real quick if people would learn how to defend themselves!. Hope you sue for lots , you deserve every penny because Chicago fired  police that are supposed to be there to protect their citizens. Be STRONG and BEST OF LUCK !üëçüôèüëç. This is the America of the Democrats and that‚Äôs exactly why our Great President Trump Will Indeed Win Big Time. Good Day and God bless.. As he should. The Mayor should also be held criminally liable. Ordering the police to stand down should make you an accessory to the crime.. I don't  know what officials are planning but whatever ...it is NOT working to protect their citizens and their ability to own and run their business. I don't  think they have mental capacity to govern.. Sue them... they failed to do their jobs as elected officials.  Unfortunately, these officials are immune to lawsuits.. the process takes time and before you know it... they are out of office or there's another distraction.... FORCE THEM ALL OUT OF OFFICE.. All the stores need to leave and let the mayor deal with it seeing she is not helping stop this. As well he should.  The Mayor has done absolutely nothing to stop anarchy.. Sue the mayor who allowed the anarchists and looters to stay. Sounds like they need to infuse the police with funds instead of defunding...it's a shame. Time to take your businesses out of Chicago.. Because it‚Äôs those darn convenience stores that cause so much ‚Äúoppression‚Äù. Chicago mayor and DA should be held personally responsible.. They can thank Lightfoot who has allowed this to happen.. stop voting for Democrats, yes it's really that simple. A class action suit seems in order. There is strength in numbers. The only problem is collecting from a bankrupt city and state.. Exactly why we cannot have Democrats in office. Turn the whole country RED in 2020!!!!. He should just sit in the store with a gun and protect himself with the second amendment. Shoot one and the rest will run out. Hope he wins and then takes that money and moves his business somewhere where he can count on elected officials to actually defend his business and the law abiding citizens.. .... All the stores should sue the city and if they can't get money, get tax breaks or Zero property tax ...... Good Lord! What is happening to Democrats run cities? Portland, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Minneapolis. Why people why?. Should sue Chicago  , the BLM marxist and Antifa organizations  and the democratic party. ....all are guilty  !. I wish every business owner would move out and let these thugs kill each other and wipe Chicago off the map. I have zero sympathy. Mayor Beetlejuice maybe can justify?????. I think we need to send all the liberals to just one sanctuary town and let them just tear the hell out of it and let them live in those kind of conditions.. Chicago has had nothing but record high murders and garbage to report for the last ??? Years...why? Do good people even live there? If so why?. Arm yourself AND sue the governor, mayor and city. Crazy!!  WHO  raised  the  people  doing  this?  Never  in  my  wildest  worst  times  would  I ever  do  something like  this...NEVER!. Think hard before you vote!  You‚Äôre seeing just how important your choices are.. Avoid Chicago at all costs... I cannot fathom how anyone could possibly believe destroying the livelihoods of your fellow neighbors is productive in anyway.... How does destroying businesses that provide services to your area help in anyway? They are hurting their own communities by limiting supplies to everyone also. Imagine if that were your own business and people did that to you? Where are these peoples humanity?. Good for the shop owner, all businesses and private citizens  who have had their business and private properties vandalized and/or looted should be bringing class action suits against the mayors and governors who are allowing this to happen!  There are still laws against this ENFORCE THEM!. Macy's is moving out of downtown. Hopefully all the other businesses follow suit in Chicago. I couldn't imagine owning a business down there right now.. So Sad! Firearms are the answer as you drop each and every person coming in to loot your home or business!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏. I'd sue the city, the idiotic mayor and the worthless governor!!. I‚Äôm tired of the excuse the rioters give by saying ‚Äúthey have insurance they can rebuild‚Äù when they destroy a business. What about those who work there? Those who needs that job to pay their bills? You trash their business and burn it to the ground, those people are out of work. Hoping these businesses learn a lesson to not set up shop in these Democrat run cities that are letting everything burn. According to Nadler this is just the same clip being shown over and over again.  The rest of the democratics especially in DC say this is peaceful protest.  Democratics should be held accountable.  Those that allow this to happen for political gain.. These cities should be sued... you pay taxes for public safety and when they at best enable and encourage this chaos they should be held accountable. ‚ÄúThey have insurance.‚Äù  At least that‚Äôs what that idiotic BLM chick said. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","['productive', 'stimulus', 'binary', 'immune', 'flip', 'clip']","['jobs', 'options', 'communities', 'financial', 'contact', 'so-called', 'funds', 'federal', 'capacity', 'process', 'job', 'enable', 'area', 'major', 'mental', 'security', 'assumed', 'medical', 'logic', 'military']","['productive', 'trash', 'clip', 'refund', 'mask', 'bankrupt', 'stimulus', 'convenience', 'inventory', 'sue', 'garbage', 'homeless', 'accessory']","['property', 'tear', 'less', 'stand', 'guilty', 'also', 'damage', 'job', 'important', 'citizen', 'become', 'everything', 'area', 'city', 'feel', 'problem', 'responsibility', 'even', 'class', 'continue', 'glass', 'police', 'alone', 'probably', 'wipe', 'record', 'lesson', 'drop', 'learn', 'shop', 'rest', 'kind', 'hope', 'everyone', 'wish', 'process', 'since', 'support', 'cause', 'control', 'give', 'somewhere', 'defend', 'second', 'last', 'food', 'get', 'major', 'destroy', 'follow', 'deserve', 'trouble', 'quick', 'use', 'south', 'personally', 'man', 'ground', 'protection', 'much', 'state', 'owner', 'insurance', 'respect', 'ask', 'together', 'fellow', 'excuse', 'hello', 'bad', 'would', 'call', 'funny', 'back', 'mental', 'high', 'work', 'stop', 'big', 'country', 'pot', 'instead', 'logic', 'town', 'next', 'live', 'set', 'like', 'ever', 'another', 'well', 'private', 'lose', 'fence', 'keep', 'money', 'start', 'virus', 'deal', 'need', 'yes', 'one', 'kill', 'strength', 'security', 'extremely', 'along', 'action', 'safe', 'really', 'home', 'red', 'contact', 'good', 'right', 'sit', 'business', 'still', 'anyone', 'correct', 'federal', 'care', 'every', 'hard', 'thank', 'safety', 'allow', 'count', 'maybe', 'see', 'think', 'office', 'believe', 'long', 'let', 'whole', 'sure', 'break', 'head', 'financial', 'time', 'tax', 'people', 'life', 'innocent', 'ability', 'huge', 'pay', 'may', 'nothing', 'real', 'way', 'leave', 'public', 'actually', 'help', 'something', 'soon', 'take', 'protect', 'mayor', 'suit', 'place', 'run', 'day', 'least', 'medical', 'move', 'provide', 'especially', 'person', 'store', 'duty', 'encourage', 'report', 'buy', 'self', 'imagine', 'answer', 'whatever', 'law', 'burn', 'know', 'around', 'hell', 'must', 'gun', 'could', 'rent', 'left', 'happen', 'democratic', 'make', 'say', 'charge', 'exactly', 'send', 'enable', 'military', 'possibly', 'political', 'capacity', 'absolutely']","['tax', 'murders', 'joseph brown', 'one', 'people', 'safe', 'help', 'financial etc', 'business', 'responsibility', 'cities', 'innocent', 'excuse', 'trump', 'chicago', 'good', 'blm', 'mayor', 'guards', 'looting', 'big', 'yes', 'red', 'much', 'contact mr', 'elected', 'law', 'police', 'trading', 'stores', 'suit', 'democrats', 'use', 'time', 'antifa', 'private', 'city', 'sue', 'fellow']","{'chicago': 0.012830579565823464, 'mayor': 0.012536918841603628, 'people': 0.012505310073074656, 'time': 0.011206602103213078, 'city': 0.010719406100834333, 'sue': 0.010501336643620103, 'good': 0.009684847634254907, 'police': 0.008611320362133076, 'brown': 0.007687190766071943, 'joseph': 0.00741996485940218, 'business': 0.007044834882905408, 'cities': 0.00684671220718603, 'murders': 0.006554780155951691, 'help': 0.006540031525600229, 'one': 0.005057743692413628, 'tax': 0.0050242413590212975, 'antifa': 0.004873446847501312, 'looting': 0.004805042862480381, 'much': 0.00477454700557769, 'democrats': 0.004693591504187457, 'mr': 0.004644866383060809, 'private': 0.00463191947794817, 'guards': 0.004428655273180982, 'fellow': 0.004428655273180982, 'elected': 0.004428655273180982, 'excuse': 0.0044019138284709805, 'yes': 0.004376341370215634, 'safe': 0.004356215906083528, 'law': 0.004316979516996416, 'responsibility': 0.004313551300207622, 'financial': 0.004290151616266089, 'etc': 0.004290151616266089, 'red': 0.004282942893472781, 'stores': 0.004192041794847094, 'innocent': 0.004189937179692532, 'big': 0.004115360456025572, 'contact': 0.004090830858451537, 'blm': 0.004081804325891091, 'use': 0.00407769518103047, 'suit': 0.004073286656466766, 'trading': 0.003984835005828079, 'trump': 0.003981303719449219}"

Saw them on a Nat Geo trip - Amazing!!!. They certainly do look peaceful and wise. However, isn't this the species that has an elite class. Only the elites use the hot tub, and they force the others to sit outside in the cold weather, shivering with their babies.  This reality of nature does not bother me, but it runs counter to most of these comments.. Pat Bosler exactly üò¢. I always wonder how do they dry themselves. So Ling Yan not only do they bathe and meditate, they can also weave towels.. Niklos Moorman and invent blowdryer I hope. Its fur could dry out like a towel. So Ling Yan with towels. So Ling Yan saunas are the most popular way to go in Japan. So Ling Yan japanese hairdryers. I think I know how they feel. Ever take a bath in a leanto shed? Snow outside? Almost freezing inside and then the hot water (heated on a wood stove)?. I've experienced hot springs in Iceland in the middle of winter. Fantastic. I feel sorry for the lower caste monkeys of the troupe that are not allowed in the hot springs whilst the elite are in. Nature in action unfortunately..

CALL TO ACTIVISM for much needed sanity!,"Voting by mail is safer if you can get your ballot in the mail a minimum of a week before the election.. Yes, people died for my right to vote, so I'll risk illness to exercise that right! Vote Blue!. drop off locations for ballots. Dave Fuller , that is the dumbest analogy I have ever heard.. Gail Dragon really explain please. Get real,,, tRunp is diagnosed psychopath. Dave Fuller voteing absentee you request a ballot from the voteing authorty. they send you 1 you fill it out and send it back carefully following the instructions.  Mail in is the voteing authority mails out ballots to every address, or registered voter, like pizza coupons.. Irene Hamburger  six states already have mail in voting. And they have been able to count millions of ballots on election day. https://www.npr.org/.../why-is-voting-by-mail-suddenly.... See my subject below.... If I have to. If that POS thinks he will keep me from voting, he is sadly mistaken.. Though we've voted by mail for years, if necessary I'll stand in line with my wheelchair-bound husband to vote out the assassin of the USPS.. ABSOLUTELY ü§ó... With a mask, with snacks and water... A catheter or diaper if necessary.. I‚Äôve already requested an absentee ballot.  If it comes in time I will drop it at the elections bureau.  If it does not come I will vote in person.. Not really a fair question. Willing to stand in line and able to stand in line are two very different things. My sympathies lie with the people who are physically unable to stand in line.. I would walk over broken glass barefoot, through a cloud of covid 19 aerosol without a mask to VOTE the Terrible Trump out of the people's Whitehouse. !!!!. For the future of my son and my nieces and nephews, I will gear up  pray and vote in person.  Early voting at a county clerk is also a choice.. I vote by mail as I live in Oregon. We've done it for years. I won't mail it this time, but instead take it to a drop box.. No, I will drop my ballot off at a designated, secure location.....

Not one single well vetted source in your conversation. Eco wackos get frustrated because they can't make their point and they start trying to change the subject, obfuscate, redirect and misdirect. Sarcasm is usually next and then denigration. Just move on. You have nothing to contribute but spewing nonsense like a child in a school yard.. Bob Ureey yes, your personal experience is vetted. I completely believe everything you say. So informative and such leadership.. Bob Ureey sure, basing important decisions and how they are administered should be based on your twisted worldview and anecdote. Because someone disagrees with you they're childish. You unprepossessing balatron.. Bob Ureey oil is a finite resource, don‚Äôt get me wrong here, I race motorcycles, own a diesel van etc but eventually fossil fuels will run out. Maybe it‚Äôs better to be investing in some alternative technologies such as hydrogen etc now so that we are prepared globally for the demise of fossil fuels! Just a thought.. Bob Ureey Every inch will be destroyed, as it has in the past, which is why protective legislation was put in place initially.. Frederick Dallinger Like you ever visit there. And if you did you‚Äôd have a hard time finding it. Substantially damaging a pristine refuge is repugnant in and of itself, but doing so when our energy situation makes it unnecessary is truly depraved. Remember this and other assaults on our environment on November 3rd.. Peter Schaffer we should use other nations oil first.. Russell Haughey its called renewable resources.  This government refuses to see that it actually works.  Eventually we will have dug all over, ruined land, and still run out of oil..

Say it with us: END THE SCHOOL-TO-PRISON PIPELINE,"We need to end police on campus! Bring back  school counselors. I was shocked when I was looking at middle schools for our daughter and found that there was an officer in uniform on campus at all times! For 5th thru 8th grade! Stop it! Our schools are so too heavy with administration, it's time to define what is necessary there!. i remember going to public school and they had to start bringing in police because of violent liberals. Church of Political Correctness You should be institutionalized.. Desiree Hrebtov one of these days we will find someone who will standup for our views.  Sure, they will probably get humiliated in a debate too,  BUT at least we will be standing up for ourselves!!! That will probably make the KKK mad!. Starting in the 1980's the US stopped hospitalizing the mentally ill and started incarcerating them, why is anyone surprised that they are doing it to physically disabled folks too?  Incarceration is the American answer to poverty, unemployment, and disability, it's what we do best, and with great enthusiasm.. Michael Garrison sadly, you are right.  Reagan closed the public hospitals and the mentally ill were on the streets.  Now many people want to get ‚Äúthose kids‚Äù away from their kids.  I work in special education.  I hear it and it makes me nauseous‚Äîfrom administrators to outspoken parents.. The most common consequence for children sent to jail is their failing that grade, because they have too large of a gap in their learning to catch up. Probably the 2nd most common consequence is their acquiring new friends (criminal friends.) The least likely consequence is rehabilitation. For some reason the government finds this unimportant.... Defund the racist public school system. Students with disabilities are the butt of all jokes. The other kids blame them for everything because they know the teacher will believe them and reprimand the student with a disability. I know this from experience.. This is why I Moved back to Canada. When we were in several school systems in the US, I could see them starting to treat my son like a criminal.  I wasn't having it, and now he's doing brilliantly. ...can not end that; it's a proven money-making niche.... As a teacher of emotionally Impaired students this is pretty much my kids exactly.  They are most likely to wind up in the system.  They get identified early, they generally have teachers who cannot or will not learn how to handle them and spend more t‚Ä¶See More. When I was in grade school in the '80's kids weren't arrested - disabled or not! I never heard about that. Have parents really become THIS inept as not be able to teach their own kids how be behave in school/society? Are you kidding me!!. A catholic school principal tried to set my son up.  Tried to accuse him of violence against an aide.  The aide told the truth; she had not followed his IEP, which directly led to a small, non-violent outburst.  This was part of a pattern of accusation‚Ä¶See More. So special needs kids who get put in normal schools aren‚Äôt having their special needs taken care of.

"Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @nlg_seattle  Learn more about NLG legal observers in Seattle! #NLG #NLG_SEA #SeattleProtest #SeattleProtests #Seattle  ‚Äî  WHAT ARE LEGAL OBSERVERS?  WHO ARE LOs?  Legal Observers are lawyers, law students, and legal workers trained to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.  Legal observers monitor police behavior, not protesters.  Legal observers are identifiable by neon green hats that say ‚ÄúNational Lawyers Guild‚Äù and black vests with neon labels.  ON THE GROUND Legal observers watch and document police interactions with protesters to deter violent police tactics and for later legal advocacy in criminal and civil cases.  When protesters are arrested, we get necessary info to connect arrestees with legal and community support.  We make sure that the right to protest is protected and support protesters when they are targeted by the state.  LEGAL PROTECTIONS When a group request legal observers, we establish an attorney-client relationship with the organizers so that our work stays confidential.  This means notes, photos, and videos we take have an extra layer of protection and cannot be turned into evidence without organizer consent.  We seek to provide as much legal protection as possible for protesters and all legal observers are trained in preserving confidentiality.  WHAT WE DON‚ÄôT DO We cannot give legal advice on the ground, we cannot participate in protests or planning, and we must try to maintain some separation from protesters.  We do not monitor or judge protest tactics or tone. We do not pass judgment on ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù protesters, a distinction our chapter rejects.  We do not work with police or act as liaisons between police and protesters. We do not release info to media without explicit consent.  OTHER PROTEST SUPPORTÔøΩNLG‚Äôs Mass Defense Program includes legal observation on the ground, know your rights trainings, jail hotlines and jail support for those arrested during protest, and legal representation in protest cases.

"The August primary is over, but can you name the current state superintendent of public instruction, the commissioner of public lands, or the insurance commissioner? If the answer is no, you're not alone. Maybe it's time to shrink the number of statewide elected officials and put the responsibility of some offices under the control of the governor. Ultimately, this would increase public accountability, writes Jason Mercier of the Washington Policy Center in an Op-Ed.","These positions should remain elected positions so those elected are accountable to the public.  Making them appointed positions would increase the likelihood elected officials would appoint their cronies.  We have enough of that in DC now.. I think more people this year can name the State Superintendent and none of us want Inslee appointing someone to that position.  Maia Espinoza for State Superintendent 2020.  I think giving the governor any more control would be more of a disaster.  No thank you.  People should be informed and should vote.. Tami Stander Kee and they don't. Most of us rely on other groups to inform voting. It's not really an individual thing. I mean. I can find out any of these people in like 5 seconds.The question is if it's useful for us to vote on this. Or if they should just be appointed positions. The Washington Policy Center is a right-wing pro-corporate think tank that's butthurt about, for example, an elected Insurance Commissioner that keeps Washingtonian's best interest at heart.. I think many of us have very different political views but what we all seem to agree on is that this is a terrible idea..

"On these hot summer days it's more important than it's been in a generation to find alternate solutions to cool down. Our waterfronts are over capacity. We recommend you find ways to cool down in the shade in other parks, or stay home with sprinklers and hoses.  If you do go to Bloedel, Padden, or Boulevard please do the following: Keep your distance, wear a mask when you aren‚Äôt in the water, and leave if it's too crowded.  Bellingham Parks and Recreation was on site handing out masks today and will be back tomorrow. #RecreateResponsibly: wear a mask, socially distance, park responsibly and stay away from overcrowded facilities.","We saw Bloedel yesterday. It was absolutely overrun with people.. Drove by Bloedel last week on a hot day, holy heck!! Hundreds of kids crammed together on the beach, zero social distancing and very few masks. Also, at least fifty kids standing on the bridge, it was crazy!!  I believe that if this can‚Äôt be brought under control, we need to close Bloedel.. Robert Munroe Agreed.. Bloedel was an absolute zoo yesterday, with people illegally parking along electric all the way to Kentucky st. No physical distancing, no sense. Use your heads, people!. Mike Kuhn Right?! We drove by and we're horrified at all the cars and people.. If Bloedel is over crowded, just let the people wearing masks in. And PLEASE monitor the kids jumping off the bridge. They run across the road--through traffic--to make their jumps. Someone is going to get hit. It's unnerving to drive over the bridge. ü§®. Padden was awful after 2 pm yesterday. People crowding us where we had set up our picnic at a beach site, not keeping any distance and definitely not wearing masks.. Does the city, parks department, county, and/or port of bellingham have plans for the future to provide more public access to the waterfront for all of the citizens of Whatcom County?  What if you aren‚Äôt lucky enough to live in a house with a yard, sprinkler, and a hose to cool off?. Suzie Dale Hong I also wonder this. Bellingham is growing by leaps and bounds.

Fortunately my advisor for my PhD was awesome. Otherwise there's no way I'd have been able to stick through it to the end.. Well said.

My full time job was at the university conducting research, and I developed additional funding to address my PhD interests. And, I was pretty adamant about living a balanced life without being taken advantage of by unreasonable demands. That didn‚Äôt sit‚Ä¶See More. Romi Jaro≈°ov√° the ‚Äúhow‚Äù may vary by discipline. My dad did his PhD while working FT in administration at a 2 yr technical college and 5 of us 7 children still lived at home (youngest was already 9 or so though, no infants). His university was also a 45 minute drive away. His discipline was English though, so lab work wasn‚Äôt part of it.  I‚Äôm not sure he slept and he did take 7.5 yrs to finish but he made it work.. It very much seems that a handful of mentors swap mentees into faculty openings and that it does not matter at all how brilliant or ground breaking the research is of the poor saps who didn‚Äôt work with these gate keepers.. Wes Grooms spot on. Wes Grooms yup. I know what you are talking about. If one individual relationship can make or break a career, perhaps it is time to put all our brilliant, critical minds to work on alternatives to the current structures.. Yes,  one  person  shouldn‚Äôt  have  that  much  power  over  someone  else‚Äôs career.  It‚Äôs all  well  and  good to  tell  new  researchers  to  choose  their  mentors wisely,  but  how  are  they  to  know  which  ones  turn  out  to  be  psychopaths?. I made some bad choices from the get-go. Some were my fault; others were not. I ended up having to ask my MA thesis advisor (from a different university) to co-chair my dissertation committee. If it were not for him, I would have quit. Drove 350 miles to nurse me through comps, which were very much like swimming though a pool of broken glass. I picked my mentors because I admired their work. Luckily for me, they are also two wonderful human beings. I wouldn't have made it through my program without their support.. It sometimes can be really tough to tell, especially when the advisors are very manipulative and are able to convince their current students that the toxic environment they created is normal. If you end up with an advisor that doesn‚Äôt workout, your car‚Ä¶See More. Absolutely the truth. My mentor coached me through my MA, then hired me as full-time faculty only a year after I finished my PhD. She is the reason I went into academia and I can never thank her enough.. My dissertation committee has been out to lunch the entire time‚Äîexcept for the head. He gets done what needs done‚Äîbut offers no encouragement. He just clicks the boxes. I‚Äôm months away from finishing and I will absolutely never teach at a public university. It‚Äôs turned me away.. I've chosen my university through my supervisors. While for me it was the logical thing to do and I was lucky those folks wanted to work with me, you never know whether relationships may change down the road. They can get better but they can also get worse.. My mentor is now in his 80s. I spend a week with him and his wife every summer. He has dementia, it is rapidly progressing, and I have a textbook that was just published that I dedicated to him. I am trying so hard to get him a copy while he can still recognize how I'm honoring him ‚òπÔ∏è. It's breaking my heart, he is SO important to me, still. ‚ù§Ô∏è A good mentor changes your life.. They can also make or break your mental health. You're extremely reliant on this person and spending a good deal of time with them. You want to make sure you're a good match research-wise, but also personality. Having an advisor that I communicated well with and was supportive was the only reason I finished my PhD.. Alexis Layman Mraz This is so true! The amount of pressure is already too high and when the matches are not good, it can lead to burnout.. So much this! I left grad school (ABD) in part due to poor mentorship. I went on to a career evaluating graduate and postdoc programs, and strong mentorship was always one of the most important factors in making a program and it's participants successful. Not enough is said about this to starry-eyed undergrads looking for the right name..  I had some trouble with this during my Master‚Äôs. I learned that valuable lesson before the PhD. I am incredibly fortunate to have had an amazing PhD chair and two amazing committee members.. Yep, I chose mine based off of research AND personality (totally ignored university prestige and location). Best decision I ever made - she was and still is unwaveringly supportive, not only of my research but of my physical and mental health.The way‚Ä¶See More. How many students can become suicidal and make attempts because of a supervisor....? So far our count is 4 and it‚Äôs continuing after changing supervisor. Absolutely choose your supervisor carefully.. In practicality, it‚Äôs better to have a poorer mentor and more well-received institution. From what I‚Äôve seen, this holds true in academia and industry contexts alike.. Definitely. Advice for prospective grad students: don't just interview your potential supervisor before making a decision: if possible, reach out to their former students as well.. I have a friend who's been through hell, is on the verge of quitting altogether, after many years, because of her mentor. I also think that it's almost impossible to tell. I think university needs to be rethought and recycled.. I had no idea who I wanted to mentor me during my doctorate. Got very lucky and met my supervisor at a lecture in the first week. I had no idea if he was even interested in my research topic but I knew I had to ask... five years later I wrote something I am so proud of that I actually hope it gets published eventually. The right mentors make or break.. When you come from a poor background, you get chosen by the scholarship team. You have zero say in either the university or the mentor.. The words are the truth - if you fail to pick mentor that is good for you - this doctoral experience can and will be a nightmare for  you.  Look at your mentor's vitae - see if they work with students and if they do - who is the lead author on student'‚Ä¶See More. Kris Machtmes exactly.. This is one of the most important post for aspiring PhD candidates. I chose my advisor and uni because I was told she was the best in my field and the university had prestige. Turns out she didn't chose me for my project or my intellect. Rather the fee‚Ä¶See More. Also, there was only one person at the university I could have changed  to as advisor. Guess who he was married to.... Also, don‚Äôt forget that students pick advisors. Mentors pick themselves, with a little encouragement from the student.. So true - It broke me for many, many years . Still no closure or accountability for egos or downright lies to cover backs.. I chose mine based off research interests and my experience with them through undergrad. WOW was that a stunningly bad move. How staff treat non-threatening undergrads and how they treat postgrad students who can question them can be very different.. The whole advisory team is important in terms of having a mix of expertise that the student can tap into, and varying approaches to supervision/training/support. I was very lucky during my honours and PhD, and got different things from my different supervisors. It's something I try to replicate now when putting together supervisory teams for my students.. One tool for figuring this out is to use social media and their website to see what credit they give to their research students. Are the authors diverse? Do the students get lead credit? Are the students presenting their research or is the faculty doing it all? Social media has really changed the game.. Absolutely agree with this - all the prestige in the world won't mean squat if you don't finish and get a good piece of work out of it, and that won't happen if you and your supervisor don't gel. I turned down a place to study my PhD at Cambridge to wo‚Ä¶See More. And do lab  rotations if you can!. Don't confuse a supervisor with a mentor in the first place. They're different things.. My grad advisor used me to do his work and hindered my work. He was absolutely lacking in every way.. This was the best and biggest tip my Honors Thesis supervisor gave me in undergrad and I will always and forever be thankful to him for it!. Congratulations for finding a fit mentor; I couldn't find any, fit or otherwise.I'll be thankful if I get a relevant postdoc mentor right now.. I changed my university from Cornell to Univ. of New Mexico to work with the right advisor. I never regretted that decision until he passed away 2 months before my defence.. Tijen Tunali Oh wow! That sounds horrible! Amazing that you still graduated though! And cool that you are in Europe too! I‚Äôd actually be interested to talk to you about our experiences and now being in Europe and all that - would you mind if I sent you a message?. Jana Wilbricht The story gets more tragic while waiting for an advisor to replace my prof.and she was the biggest manipulator I have met in my life. It took me 3 years to graduate with a finished dissertation. I am back to Europe too :). I chose a great school with vastly less prestige than a top 3 choice I had in my field precisely because I had great options for a mentor!. How do you see if your potential advisor is a good fit or not if you have never met/worked with them?. ‰ºçÊò≠Êòé exactly what I have heard from my colleagues. I agree that talking to the students is important for some kind of second/third opinions. But perhaps some students are not comfortable to speak frankly about their PI especially if the students will still be working for them for a long time.. You should meet with them at least once.  I mean you're going to be working closely with them for years.  Talking with their current and former students is also a good way to determine their mentor style.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to their current students without the PI present. Ask them straight what it's like to work with the PI and what their expectations are.. Fadil Habibi Danufane you will be able to tell whether they actively like the professor or just reluctant to criticize him/her due to other concerns. Fadil Habibi Danufane I met with several prospective advisors remotely, never in person.. ‰ºçÊò≠Êòé definitely. I think you can't be shy to work with another mentor if it becomes evident that the fit isn't right.  A bad fit might not be evident at first.. I asked a lot of questions, including their mentoring philosophy, expectations, how they approach various scenarios, how they like to give feedback, how often they like to meet, how writing papers with them works, how decisions are made, stuff like that. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to them ahead of time, talk to their students, read between the lines in what the students say. Look at their past students‚Äîwhere are they now? If it‚Äôs a newer PI, reach out to past undergrad mentees. A new pi should be willing to give references to them.. You can read about them and see if they are a bad fit for everyone or not.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to former and current students. it's so hard to know what to even ask if you've never experienced it.... but one good one is 'how is work life balance ?'. Talking to current/former students is tricky. 10 people, 10opinions. I loved my advisor when I was ar grad school, while there where people who really didnt like him and decided to leave.. Fadil Habibi Danufane Rolling the dice on whether or not a positive interaction is indicative of a positive future relationship with someone directly in your field of interest is definitely superior to just YOLOing a school for name recognition and hoping for the best. That was a long sentence.At least try to Zoom or phone interview with people beforehand. It is worth it.. Big red flag: they don't graduate many students in a reasonable amount of time. This is easy to find out.. In academia (at least in the US), the status of the university defines everything. The rest is b.....t. I'd love to be able to find the funding to go with my supervisor of choice but sadly that not currently happening üò≠üò≠üò§. The same applies when picking graduate students.. Choose carefully for  the short term and the long term  both.. Hard to do when one is assigned!. I learnt that the hard way.. Pat Owen does this count as a citation?. Definitely read it at first to be referring to our study! Might have to count it just to be on the safe side ;). Travel time and tell me this...  maybe I‚Äôd still be doing science and not drywall. And that isn‚Äôt a joke...  if you find yourself in a masters degree with an advisor who hates you...  GTFO, industry if you can..  unless you want to do a ‚Äúunderpaid‚Äù internship...  and if you think science is awesome and that could never happen...  got some news for you. Zarmeen Khan  yup yup yup.. Abso-frickin-lutely.  I chose two of my my three thesis advisors based on personality rather than politics, and when I defended, the woman I chose to lead the committee intervened at personal cost and saved my graduation date from the vindictive harrid‚Ä¶See More. Cara G. Chapel Yes. I had a great Ph.D. Advisor but I had asked a professor that I thought would be supportive to be on the committee. After he said yes, I heard from other students and faculty about how he did what you described. Fortunately, for me, he took a job elsewhere about 6 months before I defended. I have never been so glad to see a moving truck leave.. I'm not in academia but health care and you speak the truth. When I was attempting to get admission to a PhD program, I was given absolutely horrible advice from my half brother, an asshole, which helped sink me. I did not know better. Few people really know going in what they need to know and do. Mentors are *so* important.

‚Ä™How to make your Zoom look more professorial,"I`m giving a conference-presentation on Zoom next week and I was thinking that it`s going to look weird with my tidy room. It`s great that someone has taken the time on their busy schedule to make such a thorough instructional video I can utilize to overcome this problem.. Use cats. As long as you have a couple of cute furballs in the back, you could have a skinned, decapitated corpse right next to you and no one would complain. Trust me, I've tried it before. Works like a charm.. I have three cats, I know what you mean üòª. I'm desperately trying to hide that I'm set up in the corner of a room that was never really unpacked. I signed for the house the same week I did my first capstone defense, and setting up the spare bedroom was never a priority. Yesterday, work gave m‚Ä¶See More. It‚Äôs missing some random tangled electronic cords that serve no function because the thing no longer works, also: where are the random carrier bags stashed in the corner?? Otherwise nailed it!!. After my defence, when my committee handed me their copies back so I could make my ‚Äúminor changes‚Äù, I literally found someone‚Äôs name and phone number written on top of a page on one person‚Äôs copy. I could not for the life of me figure out if I was supposed to call that person or not.. I think you should call Human Resources... after you're done, of course, just to play it safe.... Andr√© Guerreiro lol, just to clarify, this was more than a decade ago.. This is amazing. Please call the number.. I'm under the impression that many commentors here have not watched the actual video (it's humour wink wink). Tom As Veines yeah that‚Äôs pretty clear.. That's a relief. I'm gonna need to see a couple of dead, dusty plants in the corner.  Otherwise the he look isn't fully professional. üòÑ. Christina Rivers Now we're talking, thanks!. I was completely called out by this video.. Krista Smith my thoughts exactly. I‚Äôm clearing out the dead plants Monday. Effortless but not quite sprezzatura. Sprezzatura is an Italian word that first appears in Baldassare Castiglione's 1528 The Book of the Courtier, where it is defined by the author as 'a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever'. Kimberley Sarah I suspect you're too well organized to feel seen by this video or to feel the need to raid other languages for words to justify a certain nonchalance and lack of planning.. Haha so much effort into appearing nonchalant üòÖ. No printer paper - printer broke months ago :( There are bookshelves in mine, but not neat at all... And I do, mid-class, break out and say 'oh,  I have a book on that!' and spend 5 minutes shuffling through it.... Which may mean they see my highly proffessional fuzzy slippers, complete with bear claws. üòÅüëèüëè Oh, he totally nailed it. The only two things missing were a leather satchel and conference lanyards tacked to a bulletin board.. LIterally LOL'd at the photos.

Also a random artefact that says you‚Äôre down with the kids, like a Beatles record or a Star Wars poster... and a guitar!. Jokes aside, if you want to look more 'professorial' care about your students, especially now.. ....I'm feeling very attacked right now. Mary Wilkerson me, too!. Who do I call about him breaking into my office to do research?  Dear God, the box his last electronic purchase came in!. How many of y'all who so clearly didn't watch the video also complain about students who don't read your syllabus?. People in the comments are like students who didn‚Äôt do the reading talking about the book cover üòÇ. I feel equally seen and mocked. Where are the conference totes? WHERE ARE THE CONFERENCE TOTES?. As one of Andrew's dear colleagues, I can attest to the authenticity he has tried to create here.. it's canned lime perrier in the actual office though. Andrew Ishak when did you visit my office?. Andrew Ishak I just can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm not the only one with white boxes stashed in the corner from my last electronics purchase....

"New study shows how to get better RateMyProfessors ratings: Be White, male, tenured, or attractive","I remember my first student evaluations: 1) more short skirts 2) your hair looks so much better down 3) the psych building is too far away from my dorm room. I decided at this point that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my teaching. ‚Ä¶See More. Kristy M Keefe My first semester teaching I got two comments saying to ‚Äúwear less clothes‚Äù üò≥ As a new instructor this was not what I was expecting and not helpful in how I could improve as an educator. Sadly, this may have been the first time I received comments about my appearance but it was not the last.. Ugh! That's sexual harassment. I got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt, literally. Kristy M Keefe I had the opposite for the hair. My hair is long and I always wear it down. Student said that I either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is unprofessional.. Students will reach for anything when they want to be negative. One time a student asked me a question about the midterm, and I said I hadn't finished it yet. They mentioned that in my RMP rating, lol. Like they never procrastinate?. Amanda Carroll were you tempted to clap back with ‚Äòdo you mean fewer?‚Äô These sites are just nonsense.  Appalling levels of sexual harassment, and not just against women; I‚Äôve known male teachers have similarly inappropriate comments posted.. Kristy M Keefe For sure! üòä. Amanda Greubel nope. I have also had some wonderfully thoughtful comments about my courses. I‚Äôll take the bad with the good.. Angry people en route.... Joshua Shinn How dare you!I'm not angry, I just hate to disappoint anyone.. Being a good prof doesn't hurt either. Michael W. Hitch I had this one professor back in my college days that was, without a doubt, the best professor I ever had. His RMP ratings were trashed because he wasn't an easy A. A lot of us couldn't believe it because we loved him and he asked if w‚Ä¶See More. Michael W. Hitch dude, it doesn‚Äôt matter for some of us. Christ.. Being a good professor has nothing to do with good evaluations, and I would go so far to say that the effective professor does not get good reviews. Do be glib though.. üôÑ. Woosh. My teaching reviews, like my article reviews, fell neatly into thirds: one third - fantastic, no improvement needed; one third - ok but...; one third - who let this idiot leave his village?

The person paying for the service should be the one to decide how that service should be evaluated.If they want to judge it on financial merit or educational merit or social merit it‚Äôs up to them. ‚Ä¶See More. Stephen Cooper Setting aside the sneer in your comment, my point was of course that the principle of having one‚Äôs teaching evaluated is fine, but the execution ends up failing it‚Äôs purpose. I doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the stud‚Ä¶See More. My favorite criticism from a student on RMP: ‚Äúevery other professor wants you to succeed. She only cares about how much you learn.‚Äù The rest of the review made clear that ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù was just about a specific letter grade.Student evals usually tell us more about students than about teachers.. My favorite criticism on a student eval: ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt teach us the content, she expects us to learn it ourselves.‚Äù Apparently the fact that I don‚Äôt lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood teaching.‚Äù ü§¶üèª_‚ôÄÔ∏è. No kiddin'?You mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest.  I'll be damned.. You're not wrong.. Tenure > attractive, any day. Promote these large nostrils and heavy baggaged eyes please.. I won‚Äôt lie‚Äî the chili peppers are from my nephews. Should I remind that correlation does not mean causation?. Innokenty Kantor you seem to assume that universities hire more poorly qualified non-white non-males over better qualified white males, whereas in reality, the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against people who are more‚Ä¶See More. Innokenty Kantor thanks for explaining my comment for me. Yes because being male or white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges. The way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face bias.. Jacq Jones Not at all. I think it is the opposite: those who think that ANY disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination, are just burying their heads in sand. Because they don't like the implications.. Ransell D'Souza He was trying to write 'of course' in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as 'of cause.' Notice he also replaced the word hire with 'high.' It's probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof. Innokenty Kantor unless you are already hiring inferior candidates who happen to fit your bias - eg white men. In which case expanded the range of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires.. What's of cause?. Innokenty Kantor yes, it‚Äôs nice (apologies for not getting reference). I‚Äôd love to see this extended to include racial bias because, sadly, I think this would be even more pronounced. And the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at best.. Innokenty Kantor there seems to be a strong correlation that white men don‚Äôt believe academia is sexist and racist (backed up by several studies). Seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them,. the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their 'existing culture' (which is really just code for biases towards wht they THINK ideal candidates are like, and the d‚Ä¶See More. Issues with the methodology but not news.. I don‚Äôt even look anymore. You must not be an adjunct. I don‚Äôt want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs I apply to every year. Well, I get three out of four.. That‚Äôs how I do it. üòä. Wait there are adults who actually care about what's written on ratemyprofessor?. No of you should ever, under any circumstances, read Rate My Professor. No good comes of it.  And I FIRMLY believe there should be a ‚ÄúRate My Student‚Äù site. üòë. Mirrors typical life. I don't bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage.. Ditto. Especially after reading a rape fantasy.. I hope you reported that.. Bob Borrelli why? So they can all laugh about it? Pick up lines, graphic sexual fantasies, sexual assault and notes like ‚Äúpretty sure I found your house‚Äù were totally ignored.. Ta-Shana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you.. You brought it to our attention years ago. White? Yes. Male? No. Tenured? Hahaha. Attractive? Um.... Brenna E. Culbert. My favorite comment on RMP was ‚Äúshe has a lot of patience, even with the stupid question people.‚Äù. Amanda Evert they repeated your study.. Sarina Kilham. Thanks. Adding it to my stockpile of evidence.. Hadil Ghoneim here you go.. I'm attractive though üòÑüòÑ. White? Yes. Male? Yes? Tenured? No. Attractive? Not really. My RMP ratings still suck, although I have a few good ones.. Jess Moore, the most frequent descriptor people use for me is 'boring'. That one cuts me to my soul. I'm fun!. Brian Paul I agree and my ratings are largely good, and even the 'negative ones' are worthwhile üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Brian Paul I just got a bad review for giving too much work for a minimester class. I'm not even sure how to take that. Am I supposed to assign less work during a minimester? I was told you're supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now I wonder about that.. Aurora Le well shit. Ami Sedani new study! More like duh lol.  Lisa Parker Lebovitz. Daniel Malcom thanks! I‚Äôve got to get back to the data, I think we can refute this. Maybe the young white male faculty aren‚Äôt as attractive to students in pharmacy as in humanities...üòù. Francesca Bosisio!!!.

Well I am an unattractive, white female and get great reviews and teach  a  subject  that  is considered hard.. perhaps it would be profitable to spend some time studying statistics.. You fulfill one of the categories, then.. Goodüëèüèªforüëèüèªyouüëèüèª. I see you don't understand how studies work. A study never reports that in 100% of cases this happens, and in 0% of cases, this happened. If that were true, providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the study.Studies look at the way things tend to be. Maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but it's not a guarantee one way or the other still.. Funny: race and gender are wwwwaaaayyyyy less important than attractiveness, student interest and discipline, but the first two features in the headline is ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúmale‚Äù. Stop contradicting the facts with your divisive ideology!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Juan Trucupey cool story bro. Catherine Glass it‚Äôs easy to laugh when you‚Äôre the beneficiary. Juan Trucupey that‚Äôs not contradicting facts. It‚Äôs emphasising some things that the study found more than others. But I bet the standard of attractiveness and gender interact as well. Juan yes it's all propaganda; it's not like they're just pointing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the obvious ones. Student interest in the subject influences professor ratings? Really? ü§™. Juan Trucupey You're the one who is claiming that it is sexist against males to imply that gender affects ratings before listing a student's interest in the subject matter. I never said that. So your complaint that I'm contradicting myself is wrong - i‚Ä¶See More. Propaganda, lol.. I literally have had female students look for profs who are called a bitch. It apparently means something different to people. Good to know. Those students just graduating with phds now, one went to Georgetown, another is a teacher..

"An academic walks into a bar, brings their own drinks, pays $3500, and leaves feeling both proud and ashamed. It's a publishing metaphor.","The drinks you brought with you were made by apprentice mixologists in training working day and night for well below market pay. They were given some incomplete notes by the prior apprentice mixologists and expected to execute the drinks perfectly. The‚Ä¶See More. And if you do not patron this bar several times every year, you are not allowed to work as an academic.. Barmaid 2 : You should have mixed your drinks with orange juice instead of cranberry juice. But those drinks are only acceptable if they are made with gin  from a recipe that other distillers can replicate exactly as well as hand-crafted tonic water from cinchona bark grown by the Agricultural college and sustainably harvested by graduate students working on stipend. üòâ. And students will most likely take a sip of the drink, find the one line they wanna cite, and be done with it.. Abdul Haseeb And gripe that there are multiple FREE gin and tonics in front of them.. you forgot to mention that the person two seats over (the 2nd customer) had a negative opinion of the academic's mixology, and suggested some edits that completely change the composition of the cocktail.. then he is hired and makes this money in a month because his boss simply trust this bar... Editor: it's passed peer review. But someone else for that issue has dropped out and could you rewrite it to about twice length? Oh, and it'll have to go to two different reviewers after that.. Works months or years to prepare the drink*. Daniele Padula it's like if you have to ferment the alcoholic and grow the lemons yourself. Then you have to invent your own drink that has to be slightly different than any drink before.. Daniele Padula exactly my thought! Takes years to make the drink and a few years to get the money to get everything to make those drinks.. This actually exists in real life. You can bring your own drink to a BYOB place and they will charge you an uncorking fee to just sit down and drink it there.. Ne≈üet √ñzel And there's also the equivalent with cake called 'cakeage'. Makes for an exxy cake.. After paying the $3500, the academic may then be contacted by the bar asking if they want to serve drinks (for free) 2 nights a week for the foreseeable future. The academic accepts. It‚Äôs a considerable honour!. Edmund King üòÜ. Reviewer 2: there is no need to clarify that it's a metaphor. Please delete the last line and instead cite a wonderful paper by (reviewer 2, 1989).. Roee Sarel and add a further ¬£1,000 if you want to illustrate your comments in colour!. Add another ‚Ç¨500 for one hard copy of your own paper.. Reviewer 1: the comment clarifying that this is a publishing metaphor has been removed. I feel that this needs to be added so as to provide a stand alone understanding for the naive reader.. Roee Sarel hvae we met?. Roee Sarel Gabriela Rabelo This though^ !!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ When you try and work out who the reviewers are by the papers they suggest xD. Bartender tells the academic they can't drink their drinks till they  format them onto the bar's menu and disclose whether anyone helped them to make the drinks. By then, the ice in the drinks has melted.. The  academic then  pays  to  read  the  labels  on  their  own  bottle.  This  is  also  a publishing  metaphor. Their own ORIGINAL SIGNATURE drinks, with recipes attached.. Then the bar had to shut down since some neighnours claimed they were serving propaganda.. Grammar is poor. Major review ü§£ü§£. Wow.  Just, no.  Not a single person I know in academia who does it right experiences this.  No one.. And them you are asked for by that bar to help others bringing their drinks. Same goes for conferences, with one zero less. This one is truly hilarious!. Or a conference metaphor. Are they published or not? Who cares then?. Melissa Weber-Mayrer. Marissa Rice.

You‚Äôre not smart enough to be purposely obtuse so I‚Äôll explain it for you. The US economic blockade has stopped medicine, food supplies and essential resources into Venezuela. Is that clear enough for you?. And thats is not an excuse to an intervenrion. Look what US made on Iraq..

I kinda disagree... venezuelan government failed seriously, there is a brutal inflation, insecurity and absence of healthcare and basic products... There are three millions of venezuelan migrants in south america as of now... I hate northamerican foreign policy as any civilized south american but this case is kinda different. Venezuelan government failed seriously? I‚Äôm sure that doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the constant economic interference of the US for the last decade or more‚Ä¶.

Why do capitalists hate full employment? Because it weakens their power over workers.,"They don't need to plan for unemployment, the just progressively eliminate human work in order to increase the profit share in the added value.. Marx explains that capitalists try to maintain a 'reserve army of the unemployed' to keep wages down. Yes and so socialists should make a Universal Job Guarantee at a living wage a transitional demand.. Wally Mooney if the JG is voluntary and is not a job created just to keep people working as a way to justify their earnings or even their lives I'm with you. Jobs should not be linked to wages if we want real freedom.. Will Eede Sure. I fully support the battle for a 4 day week also.. Reduce the working time without decreasing wages.That's what workers have been fighting for (and won) for decades, and that put more people to job.More people employed doesn't necessarily imply more wealth produced. It can also be a better repartition between workers of the time used to produce.. Wally, that was enlightening. Thank you.. shouldn't they like it because then they get to exploit more people?. Hanno Sauer I am not going to exert effort showing to you that your assumptions are just that, not logic. It is just not worth it under these conditions.. Brenton Eccles i will leave it to you to 'establish' that a guaranteed entitlement to X won't affect people's motivation to obtain X. Hanno Sauer That is a valid concern, and I think that is why we should be open to incrementalism, to having degrees of competitiveness in markets, etc. All I know is the current system in the US is far from ideal; the power businesses have over people is far too much.. Hanno Sauer the labour market relies on desperation to create downward pressure on wages: when people lack desperation, either because it's easy to find a new job or because wages are high, it puts that mechanism in jeopardy.. Capitalism requires arbitrage of labor: buying the worker's time cheap; selling the product of that work for more than the labor and materials cost; and pocketing the difference. The lower the standing rate of unemployment, the greater the threat to the capitalist's money machine.. Who says that? Because a polish philosopher suggested it in 1943?   What capitalist has ever said such a ridiculous thing?. Slavery was a full-employment system, so we must be careful what we wish for :/. They also don't offer their employees the option to unionize or participate as co-owners.. Shorter hours without loss of earnings is what we needA three day week would provide opportunity for more employees, with more leisure time, improved mental health  and a greater turnover with regard to production.

Didn't he reject a program similar to what was happening in Sweden and the US at the time on the grounds that such reformism was insufficiently marxist? Is that not quite damning in hindsight?. Not at all. His failure was refusing to support the KPD and for opposing the merger of the USPD with the KPD. He was not sufficiently Marxist, even if he was smart enough to reject Keynsian half-measures.. Christofer Koch Those Keynesian half-measures likely prevented fascism in the US and Sweden, and were not implemented in Germany. Instead, the SPD including Hilfering in practice went for AUSTERITY.

,"Hopefully there‚Äôs a chapter on how he put thousands of infected people back into nursing homes to die when the president gave him thousands of beds in a hospital ship & turned a convention center into a hospital.. Todd Hardiman facts?. Keith Price as usual a Trump supporter talks garbage out of his ass without looking into a situation and circumstances, when his president said the virus is / hoax!!!What is wrong with you dude? Have you no desire for the truth? Is it too much work  to learn the truth ? Or are you a sheep that just regurgitates what you are being told by your not so supreme leader and his propaganda of Lies.. Keith Price provide proof otherwise you‚Äôre just like the 45th talking out of your a$$. Keith Price OMG you still don‚Äôt have your facts right! Unbelievable. Keith, you don‚Äôt think he will cover missteps and assumptions, of course he will, he is not Trump who already said he is not accountable.. Keith Price  nailed it!! Keep Forbes accountable! The people aren‚Äôt blind.. Keith Price he has blood on his hands yet he praises himself with the Democratic media.. Debbie Comerford wah wah. This!. Well the ship that showed up wasn‚Äôt taking covid patients at first. They were for overflow patients. Furthermore the HHS recommended sending the seniors back. So before you spout off, have your facts straight.. Keith Price Bot!. Sam A Nasr hes a bot. Keith Price that's the problem when people (sheeps) just believe what IQ45 says, these people would end like the Waco or Guyana following this Guy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Debbie Comerford ....if he did nothing just left it alone...we would have 11 thousand grandparents still with us. They after he realized what a disaster mistake it was he past law that u could not file a lawsuit against the state or nursing homes...Let‚Äôs investigate independently stop hiding all the details of this debacle. Keith Price He has taken responsibility and has taken us through this nightmare. He continues to work hard at keeping our COVID numbers below 1%. Maybe if Trump stopped saying it came to the US from China, we could have stopped it as it came in from Europe.. Keith Price   Yes!. Barbara Sausville Johnson dont forget now trying to profit from all those deaths, makes a nice story i guess.. Keith Price Troll. An uneducated one at that!. Keith Price reading that realize stupidity has no limits. I'm sure this will be 100% Accurate and Mention how NY still has the HIGHEST NUMBER of DEATHS!!!Give me a BREAK!  SUCCESS by what measure!  In his LITTLE MIND!. Donald Furr They had the highest because we didn‚Äôt know how to treat the disease at that point. We were trying the damn hydroxychloroquine which proved to be ineffective.  Fortunately, the rest of the country learns from their failures and successes.. Donald Furr and what did you do to help?. Donald Furr you seem like an ultra snowflake.  Calm down. Dolly Tewelis DePagter nice try Blame Trump!  Noone tried hydroxychloroquine in NY!  Your Liberal dumbass leaders were too busy sending infected people into nursing homes and crying/bitching about everything!  Highest Number of Deaths that is on Cuomo!!!. Donald Furr You must be a troll üòÇüòÇ. Angie Dixon tough measures? Like signing a law that forces COVID patients into nursing homes?. Donald Furr TROLL. Ordering positive Covid patients into nursing homes was not Trumps fault.. Two words: nursing homes!!. Says the man who has killed so many in NYC by his lack of leadership,intelligence and forcing nursing homes to take covid patients.  Also blocking any investigation into his murdering of innocent nursing home people.. Cuomo sentenced almost  20,000 people to their death in nursing homes, The old and most vulnerable among us had no power to stop Cuomo from mandating nursing homes admit Covid positive people. There were thousands of COVID-19 specific beds that the infected people could have recovered in at the arena, hospitals, and the Navy ship.  So about 20,000 people lost their lives because of Cuomo‚Äôs malfeasance.. Good he can explain why he murdered over 6,000 seniors in nursing homes with his mandate.. So he forced nursing homes to take covid patients. Last number I read, was 11k deaths in nursing homes...in his state of New York. People then try to open an investigation on that and he blocks it...obviously to cover up his massive mistake. Is that what he‚Äôs claiming leadership looks like? What a joke this guy is.. He literally killed thousands with his poor leader ship and decisions in policymaking look at Florida same amount of cases a 10th of the death. What's it called how to kill the most vulnerable? And then say I did a great job. so a man in office is publishing a book detailing government practices during a pandemic that killed millions is gonna profit from all this death and fear?? And he's aloud?. That was his plan all along once  COVID-19  showed up in New York and I bet Freddo his bother  will be the ghostwriter of his book.. Will he be talking about decimating the NY economy in the face of this pandemic?Cuomo is a joke.. It was Cuomos fault that he did not take measures to enforce strict quarantine and face masks, reduce movement and transport to reduce infection. No wo der NY has the highest rates of infection and deaths in the world.. I hope he will confess in the book how hydroxychloroquine cured his brother ... but he continues discrediting the cheap med that can save lives. Does it include him infecting nursing homes? Or the collapse of Americas largest city? NY is headed for collapse under Cuomo and DeBlasios watch. Step one, keep everything open and encourage life to go on. Step two, close everything and blame President for keeping  everything open. Step three, force nursing homes to take known cases of the virus knowing they lack the ability to isolate and car‚Ä¶See More. He‚Äôs clearly got plenty of free time since he doesn‚Äôt actually make any decisions himself.. Highest death rate of all states-great success story. All is a statistical game to fit his political agendas  and keep merdia fed with garbage.. A what NOT TO DO instruction manual.. He is crying for money ,he is going to need it with all the lawsuits from the seniors family members.. Will he talk about having money ties that made him mandate the elderly that tested positive return to their nursing home causing a lot of death all alone. So glad Florida knows how to take care of our elderly. He was the worst in the country lol. So capitalising off of death by selling books... I'm sorry but both sides are fucking useless...... For  those  new  yorkers  and  califonians  relocating  to  red  states  please  make  sure  you  leave  behind  ur  liberal and  stupid  mentality behind  .... With his experience, I hope his book is on ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù!!!. Will it include how he put COVID patients in nursing homes, which killed thousands and then he blamed it on others? Prospering on the death of others is sickening.. Will it be titled, How Democrats let me get away with murder.. Can always be used as Doorstop. You people realize cuomo can be trash and still be speaking the truth when it comes to trump right?. Re-writing history, by the FX channel oops no Cuomo has its own science fiction channel.. No one to blame for NY other than yourself and DiBlasio.. Is he going to tell how he killed.the elderly in nursing homes.. New York has the highest death toll in the country  üôÑ. Don‚Äôt forget to tell them about all the nursing home deaths for which you are responsible. That‚Äôs REAL leadership ‚Äì thinning the herd.. It wasnt that great..he worried about dearhs..but not deaths by abortion. Cartoon picture book? Hopefully comes with a lesson on state responsibility and a four pack of crayons.. Front cover of book should have a giant Q-tip shoved up his nose by his brother.  Great humor after the death of so many.. Maybe he can explain how NY was destroyed. No wonder he sucked at the handling of it...!? He was busy writing a book on how well he handled it!üòÇüòÇ. You literally had the worst outcomes of any state.  What a self absorbed a hole. ‚ÄúMy Little Book on How to Destroy the Greatest City in the World  in 6 Months‚Äù. A retrospective on murder,  mayhem, crime and corruption. It‚Äôs going to be a NY Times best seller. Chapter 1 -Killing the Elderly.. A comic book?. Sounds like a ‚ÄúHorror Story‚Äù. Of course it‚Äôs more likely a FICTION story since we know many of the true events.. I wonder if it mentions how he's concurrently working to cut Medicaid while giving tax breaks to help facilitate these cuts during the pandemic.. A comedy of errors?. Is there a chapter on how he killed thousands of elderly?. Is that what he‚Äôs been working on instead of taking leadership?.

If I were their chairman or a senator in their ranks, wouldn't we plan on what to do after 2020 then we pound on Trump?. Anyone considered voting for Joe Biden should have by now realized that he is, and would govern as, a Socialist.  I would no sooner vote for Biden than I would for Maduro in Venezuela or Xi in China.  Unfortunately for their party at this point in time, this is where Democrats are.. Calling Kasich a republican, the (R) that was after Kasich name was for RINO, he is a statist.

,"Yawn...the media went to Delaware to interview dozens of people with one question. Name one accomplishment of Joe Biden. Nobody could think of any accomplishment in 47 years in office for Joe. Sad to think this is the best the Dem/Socialists can come up with.. Godwin Cofie dont understand whatever the hell you just said.. Enerio Romero Garcia , yes I don't expect you to.. Rick Jones I know right. Their identity politics will be their demise.. Absolutely!!! Hopefully the Republican Party will come back more to his way of thinking!. Judy Bass Richardson no way he‚Äôs bitter because the republicans voted against him.  He‚Äôs not for Biden he‚Äôs anti Trump. Joe Hall you're going to need an extra adult diaper in November. Holly McCool Rice 8645!. Judy Bass Richardson no more RINOs.. He's not a Republican. In the end it is about policy,  so don't bank on it.. Judy Bass Richardson Thinking that electing a brain dead liberal and a Progressive shape shifter is a good idea? Who needs that kind of thinking?. Holly McCool Rice Right on!20 for treason and 20 for obstruction!. Why are Republicans speaking at the Democratic convention!!! No one wants to hear that!. Mr. Kasich and Mr. Sanders represent the heart and sole of the now defunct USSR, oh they they also share a common campaign donor - The Soros Family. Enjoy our leftovers. Might add a little depth to a dying party.. The democrats need to stop trying to be the republican party. The country doesn't need two consetvative parties. That's why their a bunch of loosers.. John Kasich is a republican I would vote for!. Ever since Forbes was bought by a Chinese company it has been becoming the new CNN (Chong‚Äôs News Network). Who would even really watch this is he really going to come out of the basement. The only people who like this guy are Democrats who agree with he's saying. Losers attract losers. Sanders has twice forfeited what was his. Great leader he is for sure. Kasich couldn‚Äôt even win his own state in the primary - can‚Äôt get much more pathetic than that.. Thank you for stepping up and putting the country first.. Kasich would have been a great President ..Top notch person.. Just join their party Kasich, it's that simple.  You're already on their team Teeing up Socialism.  Disgraceful.. This is the election to not think in terms of traditional party lines. This is not about republicans v DemocratsThis is a battle for common decency‚Ä¶See More. Losers, all of them! They belong with the democrats!. Never Trumpers should be support the libertarian candidate not the leftist and her token centrist.. Sanders lost cause,kasich misplaying his butt with his face.Betraying America.‚Ä¶See More. I'd have more success digging up the entire state of Ohio and moving it to the coast.. The irony of a Chinese magazine announcing a RINO announcing support for Biden support is outstanding. ü§î. Even the Republicans can see how worthless Trump is.. Unstable He can't make up his mind. They won't let biden leave the basement. Politics makes strange bedfellows.. I would have voted for him last election! Moderate views and knows bipartisan is the only way to move this country forward united!. Evil !From the Dark Swamp !!!. He may find a seat in the cabinet.  That would be crushing blow to Republicans. The Democrats have broadened their support as the Republicans become the party of the Klan and curly Qanon. Lining up the comedians and traitors.. Kasich is the man to do it, he is a true lying Democrat in a Rhino suit. Just don‚Äôt be a sheep.. Disappointed with the DNC, Kasich and this crew are not considered influential outside the liberal wing of the RNC and independents.. Kasich is a sore loser and a life long politician.. Country over party.... Will Mitt Romney be showcased too? The problem with neocons is they are too vain and full of themselves to notice that both sides despise them. Enjoy your 15 minutes. And finally, go away!. Maybe Kasich can run as a moderate Democrat next cycle.. You are a presidential candidate loser  who cares what you say not changing  my mind. Trump 2020!. I wish John Kasich was running again.. No one will be watching!. John, doesn‚Äôt Joe lie about golfing and about everything else?  (RNC 2012). Kasich is still butt sore from 2016. He‚Äôs always been a good guy regardless of party.. He still cannot get over he is a loser and no one cares what he says!!!  Worst Governor Ohio ever had.  When he speaks I will wager that the evening viewership ratings will drop off the chart.. Shows the depth of the Swamp.Forbes, you didn't think this through.  But we are to look to you for financial advice?. Sadly Biden cant pitch himself because it would be too apparent  how he is even more incoherent than Trump is.. Is Bernie related to the Colonel?. John Kasich and Reek? Lol how out of touch is the Democratic party?. 'Mr. Trump I voted for you. Your lack of leadership, lack of statesmanship, compassion and intelligence and your childlike mentality have moved me to never support you again'.Sane America.. He won't change one vote one way or the other. If Democrats actually read about John Kasich's policies they would want nothing to do with him.Bet he run for the GOP nomination in 2024 and the left shits all over him..

Years later, much too late for Garvey to benefit, who had since died (he was eventually set-up and deported), after it became crystal clear to Du Bois that his belief in White benevolent partnership with Black liberation struggle was flawed, he would regret how he treated Garvey.  He finally had to admit to himself that Garvey was right, and, contaminated by Whiteness, he was wrong.  A part of how Du Bois atoned for his behavior was to leave his so-called high-brow academic perch, and move to Ghana, West Africa.

They were sentenced to prison and their currachs were confiscated.

You can't be scared of something that has crawled back into the hole she came from in November!. Daddy‚Äôs little lap dancer!. None of that surprise me!Her father is a grifter and her mother is a conartist.. Ivanka is scandalous and bleeds Money green ..she sells her stuff at funerals, government events ,  national disaster,  shes plugging her garbage,  shoes , boots , jewelry.  She ranked in $82 . Million from TRUMPTURDS last year !!!. Her walk tells you all you want to know about her attitude... Wrangler you mean!! Human handlers are called nannies!!. She  should  be  scared  of  the  FBI..

He attacks what he can't be and he can't get close to Michelle's level.. He cares only about himself. Wake up people he shows all of you everyday. You want someone like this for your President. Not me.Vote Blue!. He can never be courgel or just nice the world hates ugliness in every shape or form.  May God give him what he deserves. Now he's going after his predecessor's wife.  He's really losing it.. She has more Class than the present would be occupant. This man has nothing better to do than berate people! Such a little man! He has no business being in the WH!. He is constantly mocking people he can't control.  She is a strong, intelligent woman and she scares him.. Always criticizing someone, never stops! What a hateful human being!. You are the biggest caword and incompetent to ever hold the highest office of the land! Michelle is more educated than your entire corrupt family.. His brother A.K.A 'best friend' just passed away  two day's ago and THAT can't even get him to  forget what an ass he is for 5 minutes and say something nice! An ant has more sympathy for people then he does. He has lost most of his base now. They can‚Äôt bear his rubbish.. Maybe Michelle should tell him not to worry about her speech, she‚Äôll send the tape over to Melania üòÇ. HE ISN'T FIT TO SHINE MICHELLE'S SHOES. AS A SUPPOSED PRESIDENT, HE IS SUPPOSED TO BRING THE NATION TOGETHER. INSTEAD, HE IS GOLFING, LYING, INSULTING PEOPLE HE DOESN'T KNOW, OR PLAYING WITH HIMSELF.. THE MOST IGNORANT PRESIDENT EVER GOING AFTER OBAMA WIFE, SHE IS MUCH MORE EDUCATED THAN YOU AND YOUR FAMILY PUT TOGETHER.. He has a heartfelt hatred for strong women, especially women of color.. Isn't he supposed to be grieving for his brother?. He obsesses over the Obama's!  He'll never measure up to any former presidents, even the very bad ones.....and I thought it couldn't get any more disgusting than Nixon.. Someone slap a straight jacket and handcuffs on the orange menace already. He‚Äôs worse than the pandemic.. He just plain hates and is intimidated by strong, intelligent women!. Does he do anything besides mock people?. Someone is running scared so they run their mouth and vomit all over the country ü§Æ.. He gets more stupid by the day. ü§Æ. We have her back, but as you all know he can‚Äôt touch her.. I am sorry as a supposedly grown man that yOu are still a childish bully!. It really tells you alot when they have top Republicans  speaking at the Democratic convention.. Why in the H do people think this is acceptable behavior from a President??. So tired of this repetitious whining and lying and demeaning of women, just go away January 20th!  Far, far away!. I‚Äôd pay a shitload of money to watch a debate between Michelle and Melania!!. I want a decent person as potus. Not someone who committed treason to be placed in the office in the first place. He should be disqualified to run again. ...and the mud=slinging continues.  It is really sad when the negative comments are all you have got.. He makes fun of everyone. Only thing he knows how to do. Certainly can‚Äôt lead intelligently.. Can this man not do anything besides name calling. I agree!  He is no role model for children!  We can tell that by his own children","['bleeds', 'supposedly', 'naked']","['negative', 'constantly', 'role', 'intelligent', 'tape', 'committed', 'immigrant', 'illegal', 'comments', 'scheduled', 'debate', 'released', 'apparently', 'file']","['blanket', 'prestigious']","['watch', 'blood', 'wrong', 'totally', 'speech', 'understand', 'anything', 'lead', 'besides', 'quite', 'tape', 'sad', 'brother', 'bet', 'dear', 'away', 'weekend', 'even', 'class', 'shape', 'photo', 'old', 'seem', 'fall', 'worry', 'first', 'impossible', 'illegal', 'mention', 'gold', 'close', 'hospital', 'cause', 'base', 'negative', 'give', 'world', 'defend', 'last', 'get', 'dog', 'blame', 'top', 'tell', 'man', 'far', 'someone', 'fact', 'week', 'name', 'back', 'would', 'measure', 'bad', 'present', 'country', 'share', 'son', 'orange', 'sorry', 'sheep', 'like', 'point', 'ever', 'former', 'never', 'touch', 'money', 'one', 'within', 'strong', 'really', 'home', 'stupid', 'file', 'still', 'business', 'heart', 'anyone', 'president', 'always', 'care', 'every', 'bear', 'see', 'think', 'entire', 'nice', 'office', 'little', 'long', 'model', 'popular', 'apparently', 'time', 'possess', 'people', 'mouth', 'go', 'want', 'change', 'fun', 'forget', 'pay', 'nothing', 'chief', 'acceptable', 'constantly', 'something', 'woman', 'role', 'many', 'plain', 'run', 'least', 'especially', 'hold', 'person', 'straight', 'behavior', 'immigrant', 'brain', 'current', 'jacket', 'debate', 'human', 'know', 'hell', 'must', 'crazy', 'mean', 'die', 'say', 'send', 'thing', 'political', 'enough', 'ago']","['obama wife', 'people', 'jacket', 'everyone', 'family', 'model', 'lying', 'trump', 'democratic', 'women', 'many', 'carolyn', 'first', 'intelligent', 'someone', 'lilia garcia', 'political', 'bully', 'man', 'little', 'bleeds', 'vicious', 'june', 'anyone', 'world', 'michelle', 'donald', 'blood', 'brother', 'photo', 'president']","{'people': 0.00981172577818704, 'trump': 0.009235124755115296, 'wife': 0.008219785303005454, 'anyone': 0.007950934967219405, 'vicious': 0.00776747907121924, 'man': 0.0076738014811686675, 'michelle': 0.007168333701093587, 'president': 0.006895578195382883, 'bully': 0.006895578195382883, 'obama': 0.006826250390682569, 'lilia': 0.006690780649018071, 'first': 0.006344641190669837, 'someone': 0.0063274720674450485, 'brother': 0.006166920827077077, 'little': 0.00613127017009569, 'lying': 0.0061112485424878, 'model': 0.006103334128399233, 'women': 0.006026216684531045, 'carolyn': 0.005960917738050551, 'democratic': 0.0058927091240368774, 'garcia': 0.005868509701891098, 'donald': 0.0058161347164478, 'world': 0.005625589130797464, 'photo': 0.005625589130797464, 'jacket': 0.005625589130797464, 'intelligent': 0.00554982375050737, 'family': 0.005497850715298631, 'political': 0.005476350174890938, 'bleeds': 0.005245852623456789, 'blood': 0.005245852623456789, 'june': 0.005245852623456789, 'many': 0.005245852623456789, 'everyone': 0.005245852623456789}"

Victoria Vacher no he wouldn‚Äôt have, but we have to be better than trump. Victoria Vacher truth. Victoria Vacher so true. Victoria Vacher absolutely true.. Victoria Vacher your right not a word. Ernesto Amaya if it were the other way around, Trump would have made it about himself. He can't help but be that way.. You are correct ,..look how the little cry baby treated John Lewis‚Äôs death !. Yvonne Jimenez Kelly yup low class. Victoria Vacher  the  Other way around Trump would have said a nother good Democrat( Remember he said the only good Democrat was a dead one). Victoria Vacher what is new he (#45) only cares about himself. Victoria Vacher exactly. Victoria Vacher probably true but saying the words does mean shit.. Victoria Vacher  You got that right!. Victoria Vacher you are full of B's and liberal hate you should seek help. Barb Nowitzke the fact that you find this funny proves my point... Yer low class!!. Victoria Vacher. Victoria Vacher yes!  tRump would have probably said something derogatory (per his history of this degrading mentality) about his personality or past  hoping to make himself look better.. Victoria Vacher , that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt give a damn. I have no sympathy or compassion.. Victoria Vacher very true. Victoria Vacher Biden shows class. DumF is just an ass. Victoria Vacher Absolutely true!. Victoria Vacher shows that human beings have compassion unlike.... Victoria Vacher I agree with you. Biden knows respect and dignity.  He is able to feel empathy.  He is what we are needing.. Victoria Vacher SO TRUE. No empathy or compassion, even for his own family.. Mary HG nothing, he not human he is the devil. Mary HG   Went to the movies when his older brother Freddie passed away.. Anti-Christ. what a piece of crap.  Doesn't even care about his own family.  Only cares about himself.  Even before the country he was sworn to defend.. Condolences to the family. Who may have told the COVID denier that his in and out trip to NY was reported and he can't come back unless he quarantines for 14 days (and masks).just like all citizens who have ill relatives.. so sad for this family!  Cold and evil, one shouldn't be surprised as to what trump, donnie j is.  An empty soul!!  And the saga goes on!!!  I think Mary Trump tried to stop it!. It's so obvious....he cares for no one, no one... not even family... only himself.  That's why he hasn't and never can do anything of value for this country. His only focus is on himself, and those who support him are abetting the destruction of our country.. I thought he said they were close,that his brother was his best friend.. one day that our Criminal President will be behind bars for the rest of his crappy life...and including his family and cabinet members as well.... Bring civility back to the US, it is a great country but it is running into disrepute under this man. He is to the US what King Herod was to babysitting!!!!. Trump is a malignant narcissist. They cannot feel empathy, and see people, everyone as objects to be used  in their favor. Sure, Trump loved his brother as anyone loves a brand new computer or car. When it goes defective... Trump loves no one. Not even himself. His inability to feel love is the root of his personality disorder.. Joe Biden should showed he can put politics aside in a time of family. Joe Biden is a bigger man he put politics aside and did the right thing and sent condolences to Trmup for he's  brothers death.. .....which makes one cringe that his avid supporters have the same mindset. A scary proposition of non-caring and unintelligent.. Sounds like Donald. All about himself.. That should tell his children something.. He said he was his best friend he really doesn‚Äôt care about anybody but himself. Nobody is as important as he thinks he is!! He doesn't has no empathy or sympathy.. No one should be surprised....he's right out there, showing the world who and what he is, a VILE individual, less than VERMIN!!!!!. He's a sociopath he didn't care about his brother and he sure as hell doesn't care about America or the American people.. R I P , Robert Trump, I don't know you ,but I probably care more than your brother ,who went to the movies and played golf what a  disgrace he is. Oh but ... Him being there instead of on the golf course wasn't as important as being on the golf course costing the taxpayers more money. The man is focused only on himself!  Completely incapable of thinking of anyone else!  No compassion, no feelings, nothing!  He never disappoints with his low life behaviors!!ü§¨üí©ü§Æü§¨üí©ü§Æ. trump is a hollow shell. He has no feelings except for hate, lust and greed. Isn't it good to know that personal tragedy does NOT get in the way of his other pursuits?  What a sleaze!!! üëπ. He was afraid that he would get stuck with the funnersl bill. Nothing is surprising regarding this narcissistic sociopath with no conscience or decency. Good night and good luck. Vote Blue  for  two great people of character and kindness, and don‚Äôt forget competence.. If that's how he treated the death of his brothers, why do we think it would affect him in any way when almost 170,000 Americans died. NOT HIS RELATIVES OR RICH FRIENDS!!!!!!!. A very lonely,very ill, individual,who should be removed from positions and places so not to endanger himself and others!!. He did visit him. Donald Trump visited Robert in the hospital just one day before his death. Trump paid a visit to his ailing brother, Robert, on Aug. 14. The POTUS Wannabe was at Manhattan‚Äôs New York-Presbyterian Hospital for less than an hour that Fr‚Ä¶See More. Golf is his Best friend  any human caring person would never leave the hospital if a family member or close friend were dying. What he cares about...... Nothing  about  this  man  surprises  me  anymore.    He is  completely   devoid of  normal  human  feelings.. When I heard that his brother and best friend had died, I checked the news. Nope! Putin‚Äôs still alive.. Sitting at the bedside and offering comfort to your family vs flying off to private resort and playing golf. Priorities are a choice.. Golf,golf,golf. He‚Äôs working sooo hard. What‚Äôs that costing the taxpayers? Get him out, and take away his money. So then he can play on Public Courses.. Out playing golf with a has been football player, that personally I‚Äôve never heard of, while his brother and best friend is in hospital dying??  That is one heartless Mother!!  ü§Ø. Surprised anyone?   I thought maybe it would slow him down but he has to compete with the Dem convention and make sure he steals the show somehow.   In Mary's book, you see what a rotten, lousy son, brother, friend, whatever, he really is.   What decent person goes golfing when his brother dies?. I cannot imagine my best friend or brother with me close by choosing to golf or go to a movie instead of being there for them as they go through this scary transition. It really defies normal means of behavior.. And cause of death unknown. Bet it's Covid and Trump will make sure it will never be revealed as such. It would make him look bad if his lack of action killed a family member.. So sad to be emotionally alone....no matter how many people are around him he is just in this little   bubble of solitude....kind of like a padded room .... No surprise, he‚Äôs an evil monster!. He does not have a single redeeming quality. He is a monster.. Shhh??? He was working hard to spend our hard earned dollars. His hip swing is very important than his dying brother!. I‚Äôm not excited about his brother‚Äôs death.I will be very excited if it‚Äôs the other way around.He said they will see each other again,I wish it will be soonü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. This guy has no soul.. I guess I will play golf when they announce Trump's death: and none too soon!. Melania‚Äôs coat Comes to mind . I don‚Äôt really care, do you? Not my thought!

This is just sickening.,"I believe he is paying Putin by moving troops out of Europe...lifting sanctions, giving him classified information and turning a blind eye to his meddling in elections. As well as paying senate republicans for their cooperation..ie Russians built a plant in McConnell back yard...little insensitive like that to follow the leader. Kathleen Fils well stated. Someone said, a very long time ago I must add, that every time you see Trump do something that seems totally nuts, does not make sense, is not to the benefit of the US, whatever, stop and ask yourself one question -- how does this help Russia?  If it does in fact provide a benefit to Russia, then everything you thought Trump did that was crazy suddenly makes perfect sense.. Dana Ferraro üëç. What is even more sickening is the people who support him really and truly do not care and they will still vote for him....He is a God in their eyes.. Of course he knew about Everyone in government knew.We need to save our country from all the currupt government.We have to bring back our beautiful country back again.That is why we have to vote for Joe Biden. and Kamala Harris, to save our country.God Bless America.. A good amount of trumps wealth comes from Russia, and that was before the election. He has too much to personally lose if he stands up to Putin, so he never does. Such a wimp.. Being swept under the rug  just like all his criminal actions all his life.. a president is informed of every little thing in the world! he knew!and let it happen.for the sake of America,stand up to the con/murderer of Americans/chicken sh** of a man and under-educated wanna-be dictator!. This should be alarming to all Republicans!  Trump works for Putin and loves to play dumb.  If you vote for trump,  you will be living in  communist Russia next year! üíô üíô. Everyone else knew too and they are just as guilty as he is. They are so afraid of losing their well paying jobs and their high rank positions and all the perks that comes with it that they sit back in silence and say nothing. We already know that he c‚Ä¶See More. Just like Covid 19Decapatare him?Stonehim?‚Ä¶See More. Doesn‚Äôt matter his base doesn‚Äôt care about that even though he had a lot of people killed. He knows 1000/day are dying from Covid, and he sold PPE to Russia.Posimpotusputinoffice. He‚Äôs not concerned he‚Äôs trying to get re elected. So him and his family of grifters can continue to rape the tax payers and Trash our medical insurance and social services. I wouldn't be surprised if he's getting a kickback on each bounty. That would explain a lot, and be right in character for this heartless conman.. And the entire GOP, in all of their 'ball less' glory elected to ignore it as well.   I guess if it had been a sleeveless dress on FLOTUS Michelle, or POTUS Obama did this, the Senate would have been all over it.  The BIG FLUSH is coming on Nov. 3rd.........Eliminate them all and let's start over with uncorrupted replacements who are actually patriots.. Except numerous US intell agencies,British intell, Israeli intell and at least 2 members of Taliban along with a member of his administration have proven otherwise.. He truly doesn‚Äôt care.  Thank you for your services even under these circumstances.. And yet the GOP Senate is not demanding answers. Why?  We should all responsible for it. Our troops are not COLLATERAL DAMAGE.. Of course he knew and his traitorous acts against our military members should not go unpunished.. If a democrat President let this happen do you suppose republicans would still ignore it the way they have?. And that would surprise us....why? It‚Äôs typical Trump. Expect the worst from him and he will never let you down. If anything, he‚Äôll astound you with how low he can sink.. This is sickening!! I pray everyday that our sons and daughters are kept out of harms way !! Vote Blue üò°üá∫üá∏. Wait for malaria to get her I really don‚Äôt care coat because neither of them do. He's been a traitor since before he was president, common knowledge...OK now everyone mentally abuse me like normal do you all feel better.... I could not agree more.  Even if Trump himself ignores or does not read his Intelligence Briefings, somebody, somewhere in the chain would have brought his attention to this.  It is too whopping big for the president not to be told, and there are in pe‚Ä¶See More. Of course he knew but just doesn't care for anyone but himself. Blood on tRump's hands and he should be in prison.. Shame on all the cowardly republicans allowing Trump to sell out the U.S. to Russia üò° How dare they call themselves Americans !. The fear of Putin and greed of his payment is far larger than his feelings for Americans.. I ALMOST DID NOT CLICK ON THIS VBECAUSE I KNEW THE ANSWER, YES HE DID KNOW AND HE IS HAVING POMPEO MEET WITH THE RUSSIANS TRUMP HAD IN THE OVAL OFFICE AFTER THE ELECTION FOLKS JUST DAYS AFTER HE HAD THESE MURDEROUS RUSSIANS IN OUR OVAL OFFICE, WELL YOU KNOW MELANIA AND HER FAMILY ARE COMMUNISTS SO I GUESS RTHEY MAY HAVE COME TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS COMMUISTS WIFE.. I flat out say this bullshit. Everyone around him knew about it. He was afraid to bring it up to Putin. What a joke. Of course he knows.  The question is what did he get for keeping quiet????. He‚Äôs participating with Putin in the murdering of American soldiers.. We also know that Putin has something dangerously threatening (quite likely treasonous), hanging over Donnie's head, which is why he's so kiss-butt to everything Russian.. We know, for sure, that Trump knew over a month ago. That‚Äôs when he denied knowing sooner. Over a month, and he still has not criticized Russia/Putin for doing it, nor has he come up with a plan to stop it. Despicable!!!. So the so called patriots for Trump don't care. That says a lot about them as well. Shouldn't traitors be subject to death?. How do military veterans support this excuse of a human being???. Why isn't  that enough  for people to vote against  this traitor. The question that both Democrats and Republicans should be asking Trump is ‚Äúnow that you do know (even though there‚Äôs proof he did indeed know), what are you going to do about it?‚Äù ü¶ó ü¶ó.. Of course he knew, Barr said they talked about it!. He sold his soul to Putin to cover his debts. Plus, do you really think he reads his briefings binder?. He knew and did nothing about it. He is afraid of Putin and won't confront him about anything.. He needs to be hounded into an early grave.. If you people who believe this is true and  do nothing  your are guilty as Trump. Well well....he signed policy decisions and then has said...‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know anything about it‚Äùü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò°. Please vote Blue ,please vote Blue, try to save our country..

He's not going to go against Putin. Traitor in the WH.  Military should vote blue if they want to save their lives.. In 1980, the US military knew that President Carter was a pacifist  and wouldn't launch a retaliatory strike if the Soviets attacked.   They just hoped the Soviets wouldn't find out..

So true.,"trumputin is openly admitting to VOTER SUPPRESSION, and OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, and his repubes sit there with their nose up his ass ! ! !. Charles Pingel well said. .....OK COMRADE CHARLES!. Voter Suppression is the handlers of #45‚Äôs strategy to deflect our fear and concerns about his poor handling of the raging Covid pandemic ‚ÄòIt is what it is‚Äô #45‚Äôs response to Covid‚ò†Ô∏èWhen #45 attacks anything in a massive way, it‚Äôs always a ‚Äòsmoke & mirrors‚Äô deflection from a truth, this one being 170,000 deaths in the US as of today from the pandemic‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ÄòIt is What it is‚Äô. ABSOLUTELY  TRUE...WHILE THOUSANDS  OF AMERICANS  ARE DYING..ABSOLUTELY  CRIMINAL  BEHAVIOR... He is a disgrace to America !!! Taking over everything around us    No good Dictator!!!. Makes sense given he has no compassion or empathy for others while at the same time knowing probably prison time is waiting for him.. Jim Wazelle they provided the required ID when they registered. Getting a ‚Äúproper‚Äù Id today is not always easy, or possible, for many. Poor people can‚Äôt afford all the fees involved, and in some cases, outright impossible due to regulations that were i‚Ä¶See More. For Trump the Coronavirus, the permanent damage it causes or the deaths are just collateral damage.  I don't believe he cares at all.. Yes, he does not want people to vote. Smaller the number of people vote, he thinks better for him.. Trumptwat is destroying our democracy.  Only he would be so self serving and evil to destroy the post office for his own self interest.. The house the senate the federal courts the us barr the supreme court does nothing while trump continues to destroy America, what a shame!. He needs to be tried for treason when he leave office, just like the Nuremberg trials or Saddam Hussein for trying to strip our country of democracy and walking all over the Constitution!. Isn't that the horrible truth??!. Absolutely üíØ He doesn't care about any of us... Trump  has infringed  more  on  the second  amendment  than  Obama  ever  did  and  now  he‚Äôs  done  it  to  the  first  amendment  with  the  attacks  on  peaceful  protesters.  Now he‚Äôs  flat  out  attacking  democracy  by  trying to  deny  the  right  to  vote  or  the  ability of  millions of  Americans  to  cast  their  votes.. It is amazing to me how so many righteous people support Trump and his lying, cheating , felonious and misogynistic behavior?. Suppressing the vote has forever been a Republican tactic, but Trump has made it a slap in the face with the Post Office obliteration.. He is hoping the virus will keep people from going to the polls to vote. By stopping the mail-in vote he thinks he will win the election rigged once again. And you are more concerned about politics and should be back in your HOME town helping with all of its problems. Very true.  What gets me is he is either arrogant or stupid for revealing his plan.. Indeed! After all he is only doing what he is capable of doing that is NOTHING!. YES YOU ARE THE  ABSOLUTE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  DONNIE BOY. More people vote less chance of Donald president of Death winning. tRUMP is so stupid, maybe someone in his inner circle should have warn him that even if he won the election fair n square more then half of the population won't  believe it, and then things could become explosive in the usa. Yes he will be glad to serve second term in life prision. Why?  Because he was Black?  You are beyond oblivious to what is going on now and who is leading it.. I agree with you Bob. Now he trying everything he can do is to steal the election. The man is dishonest.. Donald's brother died two days ago. Donald say a thing until we exploded about USPS. He's trying to play the pity card.. Anyone who supports this baboon is a traitor just like trump,. So true, how come no one interferes? This shows once again none of the GOP, besides Mitt Romney, has a backbone and afraid of this traitor. I think it's the Democrats that are trying to rig things.. Ron is right - and DT is already trying to set up the argument that the election was rigged & so he can have a case to try to void it...Trump will be out ‚Äúby a landslide‚Äù but will try anything to keep the Presidency - brace up Americans, Trump‚Äôs most blatant ‚Äòscoffing of the law‚Äô could be just around the corner.... Dam right. He all over suppressing the vote but the Corona virus that will magically go away.. 100 times better than the POS in office right now.. Trump has failed like most of his adventures in business will you can mark this one as will. Failed. Or buildings or statues!! Both more important than American lives!!. So what is being done about it?. Obama went down in history as one of the best pres ever! Trump is the worst!Can't change history!. Obummer was the absolute worst thing to ever happen!.  ....HUSSAIN...You Get To STFU!!!.

This speaks for itself.,"My point exactly - this crime was a drug related personal revenge killing - hello geniuses. Why not take a friendly, happy dog as company and some happy chat ... HUH. And there are still more of them that have killed people and have not been charged, remember the young woman sleeping in her bed and they broke in in the middle of the night killed her, the guy they were after had already been picked up and was in custody plus he lived on the other side of town that's one reason they are still protesting. I guess we could protest that a man with prior felonies and two pending drug related charges had a gun in the first place. :(. They guy wasn‚Äôt collecting a taxpayer salary either, nor was his job to ‚Äúprotect and serve.‚Äù. Protest that a gun was used to kill him.. Pretty spot on that the dog is smarter than the maga. Put the shoe on the other foot and the same thing can be said about the Police Officer who killed George Floyd.  Protests, rioting, looting, and destruction of public and private property all continue.. They just don't know what they don't know.. But they will push the same narrative tomorrow. What about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about ......... Now there is something I haven't tried yet. Talking to Republican Trump supporters has proven to be an exercise in futility. I haven't tried to use a dog to do the talking however.. What are you trying to do, make them think and not hate?. Duh.... Hmmm the cops were also arrested and charged but the protests and destruction of property still goes on.. Iuzuny Garcia. yep. Erich Schlegel. now do that with george floyd. the racist act like this boys killer was fed BK drivethru on way to police station like that guy who killed many in that church mas killing.. Prexactly.. The bigger issue with this boy being shot and killed is why do the mentally ill have such easy access to guns.. https://www.mediamatters.org/.../list-right-wing.... Protesting is pointless and irrelevant. It serves no purpose except to further the racial divide instead of everyone trying to get along and work towards a common goal. And as sad as it is to say there are countless people, both blacks and whites, that don‚Äôt really want change. They just to bitch and complain. They believe that the world should only revolve around them. And THAT‚ÄôS why change will never happen.

Trump is going to hate this.,"I LOVE THIS GUY. He's EXACTLY what America need to TAKE this Country BACK from the TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. Get ALL those Republicans OUT.. Postal workers should donate some time to count votes and make sure ballots are delivered.To save their job from this tyrant. God help us if he is reelected.. trump is taking money out of the postal workers pockets to try to protect him to be re-elected!  It is sad that some Americans cannot see or want to see through his con!  It effects everyone and not just democrats!. Yes Union Strong. Support your postal workers Everyone get out and Vote Blue for Biden and Harris. okay so what say us former postal employees volunteer to count votes just for this election.. That would be GREAT,I'm sure my wife would agree,before Cheetos man fks up and steals all your retirement money,and INSURANCE. There you go a simple way to make the man in the WH go cuckoo. Next is the Republicans in the senate who block the stimulus bill let them go down in defeat this November. As of the house maintain the status quo but get rid of Congressional Republican terrorists.. Its on hold supposedly till after the election. Terrible. I made the call to the senators . Callüìû‚òéÔ∏è. Many years ago during a mail strike in New York the National Guard was called out to sort the mail!  Is it the Governors who get to call them up? If so let them call up the guard to sort and count the votes!. Joe biden's incapable of being president, the Democrats won him in there so that they can tell him what to do, and then get rid of him.. Thank you Postal Workers! Vote early! Vote blue!!. I still say he only cares about HIMSELF ,greed is a ugly thing to have .. post office been open for a lot of years took baby hurt 3 years to file bankruptcy. Sounds like a plan but you can‚Äôt count what hasn‚Äôt been delivered because of no overtime or whatever.. Maybe this is a thank you trump, the last straw üòâ. The union also did not fail to note the postmaster general‚Äôs conflicts of interest and efforts to ‚Äúkneecap‚Äù the postal system, as President Obama referred to them. The Trump administration‚Äôs naked power grab will not go unnoticed by voters in November, either. From the article.. Doesn't the new head of the Postal Service have investments in other mail delivery companies?. Fauci says we can vote in person. Vote üó≥ Blue is the right thing to Do !. How about.  FedEx. They work too. They need help. I think it's great but its just going to piss off Trump more. He is a S##T show!!. Don‚Äôt piss off union workers!. He will turn on them. I can‚Äôt believe Trump is now removing post boxes in Montana. But Trump and his wife voted by mail in ballots last week. God I despise that man. People are pissed. He‚Äôs gotta go.. Oops Henry ended up blocked.....  How did that happen?. Great!. All unions should vote democrat, the only union trump cares about is the police union and that‚Äôs only because he backs the bad people in their union. Maybe they should look at themselves why trump backs them. Get movin joe. 2 1/2 months  how many more institutions will he try to destroy?. Buy stamps!. I guess that he'll just fire them all on Monday.. Go for it get trumps ass the hell out of the W H. Looks like the pressure got to the USPS. They put out a statement tonight........‚ÄúWe are suspending the removal of collection boxes at this time. All postings on collection boxes will be removed, as we will no longer be pulling any boxes. ‚Äú. So why do the Republican politicians let this go on? Because they ALL get a piece of the action. They ALL get Republican funds from Russia or other corrupt world organizations, funneled through the NRA and other corrupt donors. If they say something, they lose any s‚Ä¶See More. Do people actually think that just because the union backs Biden that all postal workers are going to vote for him if so I have a bridge and a island I want to sale. So a Union is forcing 300k people to vote one way?. There are a lot of postal workers. lmao. Election altering my ass. That was the same war cry teachers made in Texas during the last election..

"Grammatical Genders in different languages of different regions of India Grammatical gender technically means a specific form of noun class system in which the ...division of noun classes forms an agreement system with another aspect of the language, such as adjectives, articles, pronouns, or verbs. We see that in North Indian languages like Hindi and Punjabi - all entities in the world are categorized as either masculine or feminine. Assamese, like Malayalam, has gendered pronouns. Languages like Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada have three categories like Sanskrit for masculine, feminine and neuter genders. Tamil has a unique concept of Thinai where entities are categorized as Uyarthinai and Ahrinai - (Rational and Irrational). Humans, Gods and Demons are Uyarthinai and rest everything is in Ahrinai. The first category has gender associated with it. The second category can be further classified as animate and inanimate (living and non-living) which have further specific word usage. Malayalam, the youngest Dravidian language has no gender in the verbs, however there are gendered pronouns. Telugu is interesting because technically it has the three genders, but in practical usage, there are 2 - masculine and non-masculine. Bengali, Odia, Assamese and most NE languages except for Khasi have no grammatical genders. Mundari languages do not have masculine and feminine differentiation (which is changing due to interaction to other gendered languages) but have a human-nonhuman gender difference.

Why go through the trouble of intercontinental labor migration when a regional one could suffice? The answer is not indentured laborers' greater productivity. Most planters were convinced that their indentured Indian laborers were less productive than the Africans they supplanted. Nor was indentured labor necessarily cheaper once the considerable recruitment costs were taken into consideration. The key factor may have been that the terms of the indentured contract allowed for much greater control of the labor force. - David Northrup,Duh.

Custard, jam, biscuit, tool and tent-making factories were among those shut down, with around 14,000 women from ov...er 20 different employers on strike within a few days. Employers complained of a ""reign of terror"" by the workers, and the government responded by ordering troops to be stationed in nearby Southwark Park. The strikers got assistance from the National Federation of Women Workers, who raised money and helped the women formulate concrete demands to make of employers. Companies rapidly began to cave in, abolishing piecework and increasing pay in most of the struck enterprises over the next month.

"On this day, 8 August 1942, Spanish civil war veteran Maria Perez Cruz was executed by the Franco regime on trumped up charges. A former nurse in the anarchist Iron Column militia, she was arrested in 1939 charged with various offences, mostly committed while she was in hospital after being shot during the civil war. Despite three years of imprisonment, beatings and torture, she refused to admit anything but tragically was executed anyway. A public square is named after her, and she has been the subject of two books and a play.

[Pictogram: A figure cutting down a small tree, producing a single log, which provides wood for the construction of a wooden crate.] For this reason, commodities (which are produced primarily for exchange and secondarily for use) must be produced from nature. Capitalism must continuously produce and exchange commodities in order to produce profits. Capitalist enterprises must also continuously expand their productive apparatuses to remain competitive. [Pictogram: A heavy machinery operator cuts down multiple large trees, producing multiple large logs, which provides wood for the construction of many wooden desks.] Therefore, capitalism must continuously, and at an ever expanding rate, devour nature.

"While working on updating our Learn Socialism Collection today, we made some edits to this graphic for clarity. Hopefully it's more clear than the previous version. #LearnSocialism Image description: The Purchase of People Under capitalism, capitalists purchase amounts of labor from wage-workers. The amount of labor purchased is measured in units of time, usually by the hour. When labor is purchased in units of time, it becomes a special commodity (a good or service) called labor-power. This exchange between capitalists (employers) and wage-workers (employees) creates an illusion: that a worker is even capable of selling their labor or their time separate from themselves in the first place. Hidden behind this illusion is a truth: that a person's labor and time are, in reality, inseparable from their person. [Pictogram: A triangle, with a person at the top corner, a hand holding a wrench (representing labor) at the bottom right corner, and a hand holding a clock (representing time) at the bottom left corner.] This means that with the sale of human labor-power comes the purchase of not only people's labor and time, but also of people. The basic difference between the slave and the wage-worker is this: the slave is sold by another all at once and as a whole, while the wage-worker must sell themselves to one capitalist or another, again and again, hour by hour, piece by piece.","+- 12 hours somewhere. +- 12 hours somewhere.

"Our Lives Are Essential, Capitalism Is Not As the number of infected and deceased increases during this pandemic, we, the working class, continue to pay for the consequences of Capitalism, its ambition and maliciousness. Many governments have refused to enact total quarantines, and those who have, have established all sorts of tricks to ensure the normal functioning of trade and production, forcing us to risk dying from COVID-19, whether through work or hunger, without income... or economic protection to face this crisis and provide for our families. Likewise, we have witnessed the epic image that has been built around health workers, who are really risking their lives to save others, without adequate protection, sufficient personnel, and the equipment necessary to truly combat the pandemic. What they call heroism is precarity; appealing to heroic applause for those who should be able to serve safely. With horror we see how the police and repressive forces that circulate through the streets implementing control over people have these security elements financed by public spending. In other words, the priority is repression and control of the population, instead of taking care of and providing the essentials for life. The working class has to participate in decision-making about this crisis, about who will pay for it, about what measures will be taken in the territories to deal with it, we cannot simply be spectators at this juncture. In turn, the call is to take care of ourselves, to unite in these times of estrangement, to express more solidarity and not let go. Only solidarity and mutual aid will allow us to resist.

It‚Äôs 2020 but some people are mad over women talking about their sexuality.,"Pretty sure Ben Shapiro is a hamster that was cursed by a witch with a human form for wanting to tell everyone what to do.. John Garlick. I'm mad that its bad. Bring back Missy Elliot.. That's all I can think it is. You would suppose Ben Shapiro would be so happy. The song glorifies rich men, alpha males and chads like an incel forum turned into a chart-topping hit. It has to be that women aren't allowed to talk about sex, because otherwise they should really love this song.. I think the song sucks but that‚Äôs just one person‚Äôs opinion. Women should do whatever the fuck they want. Call me old but I remember when conservatives were outraged at Salt-N-Pepa for owning their sexuality . I'm pretty sick and tired of people being shocked or digusted by women's expression and power over their sexuality. Some men brag about wanting nasty sex and having wet dreams with wild fantasies, but get triggered at the fact that women are or can be kinky too üò¨.. Didn't Salt n' Peppa make a song/video about the exact same thing 25 years ago? And society still can't handle it? That's some serious snowflakeism.. What bothers me isn't the song, it's nice, it's the discussion surrounding it. Obviously annoying are the Ben Shapiros, but I don't expect anything else from them honestly, so what bothers me quite more is alot of people claiming this would be empoweri‚Ä¶See More.

We're still in process of finding a new social media director after our previous director stepped down, but expect some sporadic updates throughout the weeks until everything has been completely put back in order. A few updates since the election of the 2nd Central Committee in October 2019: ->Our Central C...ommittee now has 12 seats, 4 of which are trans, and 6 of which are women or nonbinary. ->Work has continued on our instructorship program, with tentative plans to have solid progression on it by end of March. ->Our Northern Virginia chapter attended a session of the Virginia Legislature and spoke to law makers directly about their stances on gun legislation. ->We welcomed our first Puerto Rican members, and hope to establish a chapter in the territory this year.","I'd like to get in touch with some people in South Florida.

Commies aren't people.. they are property of the state.. Now is the time to be active again.... I hope you become more well known because people I think base their feelings about firearms on hating the NRA. Why are some ""laughing."" What about this is funny? Are there trolls in here?. Wouldn't it be better to just introduce the Central Committee instead of just vaugely listing their stats? Some may find it depersonalizing to just be called 4 trans 6 women or nonbinary. Why is it that the women and nonbinary are bing lumped together? Is it to indicate non-men? Why arent nonbinary people included in the trans category? Just found that a little weird.

Daniel Newman I agree with your sentiment about the 'sheltered urban liberal,' but I think people like that are way less common that people think. When it comes to guns, we all know how easy it is for the wrong people to take the soapbox and social media kinda blows public perceptions out of proportion. Daniel Newman I don't judge anyone who hunts out of actual necessity but that's about 1% of the people who do, realistically. And I'm just saying it isn't necessary for most of us and it's not cheap. Most people do not use only a 20 year old rifle and some bullets. That's just not the truth of hunting culture..

"Just so we're all clear -- this is what an assault weapons ban looks like. It would take every bit of political capital the Democrats have built over the last three years, and the only real-world effect would be that you can buy the gun on top, but not the gun below. The basic function of a rifle -- sending a bullet out of a barrel -- is what makes it deadly. Any legislation restricting the features on a rifle will lead to the production of loophole guns that are equally powe...rful but manage to avoid the ""assault weapon"" category. This isn't even getting into the fact that there are *at least* 5-10 million fully-featured AR-15s already in circulation in the United States. So even if a ban were to pass, it would be functionally irrelevant. Image Description: An image displaying two AR-15 platform rifles that are almost exactly the same, save for three small differences. One rifle is labeled ‚ÄúNot an Assault Rifle At All‚Äù, the other is labeled ‚ÄúDefinitely an Assault Rifle‚Äù. At the bottom, an SRA logo and text that reads: ‚ÄúThe Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 did not reduce the availability of rifles in the US, nor did it make them any less lethal. In function, the law created an environment where manufacturers produced the same firearms with slightly different features, while artificially inflating the value of pre-ban models.‚Äù","One slight problem. There is a difference between assault rifles and assault weapons. An assault rifle is a select fire shoulder weapon chambered in an intermediate cartridge and was already regulated by the NFA as a machine gun before they were even invented. An assault weapon is whatever the fuck liberals in New York and California want to call it in order to make sure citizens can't have good guns.. Putting your focus on arguing semantics vs broadly accepted nomenclature is not going to help anything,. Randall Munro broadly accepted doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs correct.. Randall Munro except that's not semantics. that's literal legal definition of an assualt rifle. and assualt weapon can literally be anything someone deems scarey. theres no legal definition for it at all. Being incorrect on legal technicalities doesn't help our image much either. Don't act like no reactionary will ever see it, pick it apart, and tell everyone we don't know what we're doing.

Lol. You know what the only distance between a semiautomatic rifle and a pistol is? Effective range and rifles require two hands to shoot and can't be concealed. That's it. Both are equally deadly. Just because you are afraid of the word semiautomatic doesn't mean it's an assault weapon. Pistols are semiautomatic too. Are you gonna ban them too?. Jonathan McCowan the IRA brought no-one to a standstill, the (now threatened due to Brexit!) Good Friday Agreement happened because enough ordinary people from both sides of the divide & the political orgs had seen enough bloodshed from terrorists & the sometimes murderous British army. They didn‚Äôt win peace through violence, despite the idiotic funding from Irish Americans in the previous decades.. I read that the US military forces amount to roughly 1.250.000 people.. Bruce Andrew Hansen support the 1st amendment.  But remember only support non-auto refill pens or electronic communications.  Support quill and ink on paper only.  Do not support widespread automatic communications.. Broose Andrew Hansen I don‚Äôt believe the 2cnd amendment has any type of wording banning any type of weapon ... sorry. Peter, that‚Äôs an argument for citizens to have more strong and powerful weapons, not less of them.  I do believe the government would bomb its own people but if they plan on winning, they‚Äôll still need the infrastructure to maintain some semblance of sanity among those that didn‚Äôt rise up.. ""Sometimes murderous British army"" ha. Understatement of the fucking year.. Broose Broose imagine trying suppress the right of the workers to secure themselves from the bourgeois with an effective firearm. Anthony Plisko. Broose Broose I‚Äôm a communist. As left as they come. I‚Äôll tell you right now, this is an idiotic take.. The solution isn't to ban the WEAPONS, but the CALIBRES - the 5.56x45mm bullet is a military cartridge that has no function in either home defense or hunting, designed to be lightweight enough to allow fully automatic fire but still lethal - hell, one ‚Ä¶See More. These comments litteraly gave men an aneurism,. Wasn't it Reagan that started the assault rifle ban and was against civilians having ar-15 type weapons?. Not that it matters to the wealthy;as long as you've got the money and a ""clean""record you can get the tax stamp for any Firearm.I know guys w/fully automatic MP-5s!Our firearms laws need overhaul from stem to stern starting w/Firearms  safety education being mandatory in schools!. Ahhh , so if I‚Äôm shot and notice no bayonet lug I can relax knowing how much worse my bleeding would be if it was an assault rifle. Pointing this out may just lead to Canada style bans. It's frustrating.. Seems a firearms class would really help lawmakers.

I can't tell if this is satire. All of the essential things that make an assault rifle are maintained. I'm not saying I disagree with the premise but you can't tell me there is a fundemental difference between an M16 and an AR15. Now we are getting somewhere.. While we are literally filling concentration camps seems an incredibly odd time to pass any sort of gun control legislation.. What‚Äôs the functionality difference between a threaded and non threaded barrel?. Ain‚Äôt it grand how current talk is focused on Armalite and Kalashnikov, but no mention of the other major companies that produce far better job security for the undertaker.Take Barrett Arms.

The MA has been around for many decades, and collectors/reenactors  can still get a BAR or something if they want, but nobody's been getting killed with them.. Dont ban the gun then, ban the ammunition. Make it so you can only buy ammunition at licensed target ranges, and you're not allowed to take the ammunition home.. Any weapon not capable of selective fire is ipso facto NOT an assault rifle lacking one of the defining features of the category.. Don't forget the pistol grip makes it a lot more deadly, if you live in NY.. Bayonets are pretty cool though. I like spears. Spears are good.. i did not know this before i saw this.thanks for the educationü§ôüèª. Naw, I don‚Äôt agree with this. Large capacity magazine bans definitely save lives.. Expect AWB 2.0 to just ban semi-automatic rifles.And expect the next evolution of the AR pattern to allow you to cock it with your thumb or something like that.... This is what a legal AR-15 looks like with an ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù ban.  Still shoots the same, just less comfortable to hold.. No such thing, Full Auto, semi-auto or single fire. The suppressor ban has somehow kept mass shooters loud though.. here you go Kevin Gilbert, these are the types I associate with. You forget the 3 round burst to fully auto. They wanna ban both. And confiscate all that are already out there.. Eric Knabe. Austin Rose. I'll take my 12ga with a 3.5"" in buck over these toys any day. This all assumes they'd call an assault rifle the same thing as the old ban.That said. I really don't see any particular weapon ban working when almost any other kind of firearm would be just as effective.‚Ä¶See More. That‚Äôs not true you can limit it to just single action rifles and not 30 round clips. Combat rifles like ARs aren‚Äôt the same as simple hunting rifles.. Roberto Acquafredda.. Also, pick up your shit while you still can.  Extended mag bans almost always come first. When did all these gun grabbers start following this page? If it's such an issue to you then move to freaking Canada... Where owning a firearm IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.Don't try to abolish that right here just because you think it's acceptable fo‚Ä¶See More. Fixed this for you.. So my rifle will be worth more money?  Thanks dumbocrats!. The majority of the population supports banning them.  Left slanted polling shows about 75%, the recent polling from Fox News, obviously right slanted, shows 66% in favor of a new, permanent AWB.. I sort of assume but does anyone know if the 3% who own half of all guns (8 or more each person) are mostly or all white supremacists?. Forgets selective fire is the main definition of an assault rifle. 2019 assault weapons ban bill.https://www.congress.gov/.../116th.../senate-bill/66/text. Chris Brian Swientek confirm?. It's an assault weapon,  built for 1 thing only. Kill lots of people very quickly. The only difference between the civilian and military M16 is the switch to full automatic.  It's like letting anyone drive a semi truck or passenger bus without training.. Dead schoolchildren the price we pay so some smalldicked boy can prance around playing scary army man enlist u pussy oh yea that shoot back pussys.

"Doxxing is serious threat that we need to keep in mind as we engage in physical and online activist spaces. The most vocal organizers and content creators are more vulnerable, but the reality is that some fascists will attempt to doxx you for as little as showing up to a peaceful protest. In the past, this has lead to online harassment campaigns, workplace harassment, death threats -- and as we saw just this summer in Philadelphia -- it can even escalate to an armed far-right street gang showing up to your home to intimidate and harass you directly.

"Many ‚Äî if not most ‚Äî of the people ICE and CBP target have indigenous roots in the Americas extending back long before European settler arrival and the eventual western expansion of the United States. This reality illuminates the true role these agencies play; the militant arm of a violent settler-colonial project, responsible for targeting indigenous and other ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù populations as our liberal-democratic systems of governance decay into an increasingly reactionary, fa...scist form. In light of the recent news regarding plans for an ICE training facility with ‚Äúsimulations of homes in Chicago and Arizona,‚Äù that are so ‚Äúhyper-realistic‚Äù that they include details like ‚Äúdishes in the sink, toys in the yard,‚Äù it becomes clear that ICE is even further militarizing themselves to target communities at home. Rightly alarmed by these developments, more and more people have been asking how they can defend their communities from being torn apart by raids and other anti-immigrant ICE actions. One such tool is the Rapid Response Network. Rapid Response Networks can use a variety of tactics in response to ICE raids ‚Äî some send teams to provide legal council, some collect information so families‚Äô loved ones are not lost in the immigration system, some send volunteers with video equipment to film encounters.

"Fred Hampton, Deputy Chairman of the Black Panther Party, was a young revolutionary who did a better job than anyone using materialist analysis to illuminate the common source of all the varying struggles faced by different sub-sections of the working class in the United States. Namely, the inherently exploitative nature of the capitalist mode of production. While Hampton and the BPP were committed Marxists, they did not take a class reductionist point of view. They incorpora...ted race not only in their materialist analysis, but also in their praxis. In 1968, Hampton helped organize the Rainbow Coalition, a multi-racial coalition of street gangs in Chicago, united behind the understanding that racial and ethnic conflict between gangs would only keep its members entrenched in poverty. Hampton was so effective in his work of uniting the proletariat, so threatening to the existing Capitalist economic order, that the FBI decided to murder him in bed, in the middle of the night, during a no-knock raid, as he slept next to his partner. The FBI organized a death squad. And they achieve their goal. Twenty-one years old. 21. The city of Chicago and the federal government ultimately had to pay $1.85 million to families of the deceased (the largest-ever civil rights settlement at the time) because the state‚Äôs actions were so egregious. It was an unspeakable loss for the countless people who knew and loved Hampton. But at the same time, as Hampton himself acknowledged: ‚ÄúYou can jail revolutionaries, but you can‚Äôt jail the revolution‚Ä¶ You might murder a freedom fighter‚Ä¶ but you can‚Äôt murder freedom fighting.‚Äù Image Description: Image of Fred Hampton with text: ""I ain't going to die in no airplane.

"MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ‚Äî We Need YOUR Help! The SRA is fundraising for its disaster relief operations ahead of Hurricane Dorian's landfall on the Atlantic coast. With your help last year we raised $1300 for Hurricane Florence and $3500 for Hurricane Michael. This year we're asking for $5000 for an even larger relief effort under our new SRAid banner (which will be launching independently next year as its own 501(c)(3) charity!) Your donation will be used to purchase food, water, ...blankets, first aid, diapers, menstrual products, and other essential supplies. Our Southeast Disaster Relief Coordinator will stage near Gainesville, GA along with our volunteer members. Depending on when and where the storm makes landfall we will either deliver supplies to emergency shelters before the storm hits, or venture into the affected area after the storm has passed. In either case we will try to make sure our donations are made available to vulnerable and under-served populations that may not be able to rely on FEMA or the Red Cross for assistance. Any donations in excess of what we are able to put towards relief for Hurricane Dorian will be used in future disaster relief efforts, or will be put towards a generator and other improvements for our new disaster relief trailer. The SRA is dedicated to improving community resiliency in the face of climate change and its attendant natural disasters.

"‚Äú'I want more leftists and even just plain (democratic socialists) open to the idea that guns are not inherently evil,' Alex Tackett, the 22-year-old president of the newly formed Socialist Rifle Association (SRA), said in a recent Reddit AMA.  Founded last year, the SRA says it aims to help members of the working class effectively defend themselves and their communities. 'Defense' is defined broadly: the group‚Äôs 52 chapters around the country have organized disaster relief e...fforts and litter clean-ups along with firearm safety classes and gun range days. The group exists in part to be a leftist alternative to the NRA, which Tackett considers a 'reactionary, capitalist institution.' The organization believes marginalized groups, including people of color and LGBTQ people, should have a space where they can learn how to use firearms to defend themselves. The group‚Äôs vice president, Faye Ecklar, a transgender socialist, says that it‚Äôs about creating 'a culture in which guns are a small part of a much larger revolutionary project to build communities that don‚Äôt need to rely on the state for protection.'""","Your Socialist ideology and private gun ownership are incompatible..

"The AK-47 -- officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova -- is a gas-operated, 7.62√ó39mm rifle. Developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov rifle (or ""AK"") family. Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945. In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. Even after seven decades, the model and i...ts variants remain one of the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of its reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region, and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual, crew-served and specialized firearms. As of 2004, ""Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s"".

"It‚Äôs important to note that this far-right terrorist killed his step-sister before he failed in his attempt to kill Muslims in their place of worship. When you contextualize this murder with the Dayton shooter who killed his brother (a trans man who had recently begun to share their gender identity with trusted friends), and also with the Isla Vista shooting in 2014 carried out by an incel, you see that there is an unmistakable thread of misogyny running through these terror ...attacks. Sometimes it emerges in the form of patriarchal, hierarchy-obsessed fascism, as is the case with this Norwegian terrorist. Other times it emerges in the form of misogynistic incel culture, as is the case with the Dayton and Isla Vista shooters. Regardless of the particular ideological bent, it‚Äôs essential that we remain as steadfast and vigilant in our fight against misogyny and transphobia, as we do in our fight against racism and xenophobia.

"Paulo Freire contributed a philosophy of education which blended modern Marxist, post-Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. During his childhood and adolescence at school, Freire ended up four grades behind, and his social life revolved around playing pick-up football with other poor children, from whom he states to have learned a great deal. These experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire state...d that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: ""I didn't understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn't dumb. It wasn't lack of interest. My social condition didn't allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge"".

"‚ÄúForcibly disarming blacks in the South was among the early Ku Klux Klan‚Äôs reasons for organizing and one of its first goals. They knew what today‚Äôs well-meaning advocates of gun control do not ‚Äî that the black letter of the law is one thing and de facto power relations are quite another.  These gun control laws were passed to disarm black citizens. We might do well to keep this history in mind today when we consider how new, more restrictive gun laws will be applied. Were th...e mere dictates of positive law the panacea that mainstream progressives believe they are, the history of this country would have looked very different.  Today, gun control legislation aggravates the criminal justice crisis in the United States, having a disproportionate impact on black Americans... Some left-wing groups are beginning to understand this and respond accordingly, abandoning the irrational and baseless conventional wisdom that support of robust gun rights is somehow conservative. The Trigger Warning Queer & Trans Gun Club and the Socialist Rifle Association are just two of the growing number of politically left-wing gun clubs and affinity organizations popping up with the goal of arming and preparing vulnerable groups.

"‚ÄúDuring the first night of the second Democratic presidential debate, the question of how to reduce gun violence emerged as one issue on which the sometimes-splintered Democratic Party speaks with as close to one voice as it can. Candidate after candidate repeated a list of proposals they would try to enact if they become president: universal background checks, a so-called assault weapons ban, restrictions on magazine capacity, and laws to prevent those with history of mental illness or domestic violence from buying guns. But researchers who study gun violence question how effective some of the Democrats' proposals would actually be if turned into law.‚Äù","Taking guns away only hurts marginalized communities and gun control laws have been inherently racist since their inception when African Americans started standing up to the clan and chasing them out their towns.

"Movimiento 26 de Julio The 26th of July Movement (Spanish: Movimiento 26 de Julio; M-26-7) was a Cuban vanguard revolutionary organization and later a political party that in 1959 overthrew the Fulgencio Batista dictatorship in Cuba. The 26th of July Movement's name originated from the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks, an army facility in the city of Santiago de Cuba, on 26 July 1953. This attack was led by a young Fidel Castro, who was a legislative candidate in a free ...election that had been cancelled by Batista. The attack had been intended as a rallying cry for the revolution.  Castro was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison but, along with his group, was granted an amnesty after two years following a political campaign on their behalf. Castro travelled to Mexico to reorganize the movement in 1955 with several other exiled revolutionaries (including Ra√∫l Castro, Camilo Cienfuegos, and Juan Almeida Bosque). Their task was to form a disciplined guerrilla force to overthrow Batista. On 2 December 1956, 82 men landed in Cuba, having sailed in the boat Granma from Tuxpan, Veracruz, ready to organize and lead a revolution. The early signs were not good for the movement. They landed in daylight, were attacked by the Cuban Air Force, and suffered numerous casualties. The landing party was split into two and wandered lost for two days, most of their supplies abandoned where they landed. They were also betrayed by their peasant guide in an ambush, which killed more of those who had landed. Batista mistakenly announced Fidel Castro's death at this point. Of the 82 who sailed aboard the Granma, only 12 eventually regrouped in the Sierra Maestra mountain range.  While the revolutionaries were setting up camp in the mountains, ""Civic Resistance"" groups were formulating in the cities, putting pressure on the Batista regime. Many middle-class and professional persons flocked toward Castro and his movement. While in the Sierra Maestra mountains the guerrilla forces attracted hundreds of Cuban volunteers and won several battles against the Cuban Army.  Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was shot in the neck and chest during the fighting, but was not severely injured. (Guevara, who had studied medicine, continued to give first aid to other wounded guerrillas.) This was the opening phase of the war of the Cuban Revolution, which continued for the next two years. It ended in January 1959, after Batista fled Cuba for Dominican Republic, on New Year's Eve when the Movement's forces marched into Havana.

"On this day, 18 August 1945, the Japanese Ministry of the Interior ordered police to be setting up ""sexual comfort stations"" (i.e. brothels) for US occupation troops, just before the start of surrender talks (content note: sexual violence). Local authorities and businessmen established a network of brothels under the Recreation and Amusement Association, which was state-funded, some in places like police dormitories. At its height, the RAA had 70,000 women working in its brot...hels, with around 80,000 at independent brothels for the 350,000 US troops in the country. The first brothel established by the RAA, Komachien (""The Babe Garden"") had 38 women, who had 15-60 clients each day. The official justification for the network was ""to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls."" US military officials were aware that some women in the brothels had been enslaved, and others coerced or tricked by responding to fake advertisements for other jobs. One 19 year old girl, Natsue Takita, responded to an ad for an office worker. She was then told the only available posts were for ""comfort women"" and persuaded to accept it. She killed herself by jumping in front of a train a few days later. A memo from Lt Col Hugh MacDonald explained ""The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family"". He also admitted that ""in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists."" Eventually, facing rampant sexually transmitted infections amongst the troops, as well as complaints from army chaplains, Gen MacArthur declared the brothels off-limits to US personnel on 25 March 1946.

"Well everyone has an end to their competitive time in speech and debate, and most everyone has their obligatory end of career post.

The tldr is that I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve spent 8 years competing in speech and debate and met so many amazing people I have thanks for.  Starting back in high school, freshman year me didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd end up a debate kid until my mom sugg...ested I take it as an elective. My debate teacher and coach Mr Zuercher was formative for making me enjoy debate and wanting to purchase inconceivable amounts of books probably for the rest of my life. My best friend, Quentin McTeer, was the biggest motivator to push myself to be good in debate and want to succeed. I remember spending summers at debate camps, weekend debate tournament trips, and the unnecessary amount of time we were working on debate prep in other classes.  My two years of debate at the College of Idaho were filled with some of my closest friends and most fun memories. We only got to debate for a year, but Logan Dennis was one of my most fun partners and one of my brothers. All that blabbering incoherent rambles about Deleuze even got you to slip a quote in your senior paper. Aanish Shamim is the funniest, nerdiest person ever and has been my friend since high school. We were partners on and off for two years, but to date you‚Äôre still the only person I‚Äôve gotten 1st place at a tournament with #unr. I‚Äôll never forget our ukulele anthem PMC‚Äôs.  My last year at WWU has been a great end to my years in debate. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact you were my favorite competitor when I was at CofI I probably wouldn‚Äôt have ended up here. Chris Coles (Lila Lavender), you‚Äôre one of the smartest people I‚Äôve ever met and have appreciated your guidance in debate and beyond. Kinny Torre is also an amazing person I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve met from moving to WA. Being able to work with you at debate camps the last two summers and call you my coach and close friend is something I‚Äôm really grateful for. Sarah Wheeler and Brenner Barclay have been the worlds best teammates to have and the best company at our sometimes week long debate-ventures. Margaret Rockey was always supplying the groovy tunes and campaign to eat more chicken. And lastly, Cameron Allen, you‚Äôve been a hoot and a better partner than I could‚Äôve asked for.

"hi! as many of you know, I spent senior year (and will spend this upcoming summer) as an intern for prof. Colin Marshall at the UW.

"Well cant believe that today marks the end of what seem to have been a super fast year. 2019 brought so many challenges. From divorce to academic failures, to performance failures, and death of a few people who I had the privilege to serve this great country with. It has also given me some of the best moments I have had in life. It has restored and created some great friendships, I have become a much better musician, and I have learn to take some of punches and move on. I am ...truly happy for every moment that happened this year, good or bad because they are all learning experiences that will help make this coming year great. To all of you who have allowed me into your lives and to those I have had the change to be around this year thank you so much for all the wonderful memories of 2019.

Surely if I had existed from all eternity I should have given and consecrated to you my whole soul, my whole heart, all my thoughts, designs, and affections. But not having existed from all eternity, I should at least have turned to you with my whole mind and will as soon as I was capable of doing so. Alas! I can truly say with Saint Augustine, ‚ÄúToo late have I loved you, O Eternal Goodness.‚Äù Forgive me, I beseech you, O my God.

Don‚Äôt mind my feelings so long as I remain completely yours. Lord, don‚Äôt allow my feelings to spoil the beautiful handiwork you have begun in my soul. Cut me into pieces. Every piece will be yours.    Humility of the Heart of Jesus, fill my heart. Purity of the Heart of Jesus, purify my heart. Charity of the Heart of Jesus, fill my heart. Jesus, I am here, love me!

"Hi! I‚Äôm Zac Davis and I‚Äôm looking to coach and judge for students this debate season,So you‚Äôre probably wondering why you should consider me:As a debater I was successful on the national circuit and qualified to the TOC twice despite lacking a school debate coach or strong institutional support, going 3-3 as a Junior and choosing to coach rather than attend Corona-toc. Other notable results include a positive record at NSDAs being ranked 6th in California by the NSDA, and bei...ng a runner up at the Apple Valley RR, winning the VBI Varsity tournament and reaching quarterfinals at RKS‚Äôs Varsity tournament.However, not all good debaters are good teachers. I‚Äôve always placed heavy emphasis on a strong foundation so I focused on research and understanding the philosophy behind the arguments I read. This philosophy transfers heavily into my coaching style. I want to enable students, not think for them.  I have experience coaching 40+ debaters for Policy, LD, and Parliamentary debate and have worked with programs such as PepTalk, W.indebate, ODI, VBI, UTNIF, and currently Triumph Debate. While I was still debating I founded and organized Verge Debate, a mutual prep sharing and coaching team for small school debaters without school coaches, and so I have lots of experience coordinating prep assignments, talking about strategies, and assisting with long term and pre-round preparation and a majority of our members reached TOC for the first time as Verge members. I am familiar with overcoming prep disparities, organizing collaboration in drills mocks and prep assignments, and providing specialized and flexible support to different debaters needs. Over the summer alone I‚Äôve judged 40+ rounds, so I have plenty of experience working online and in-depth knowledge of modern debate trends. In summary I‚Äôm incredibly passionate about debate content and strategy and have the experience to back it up.For those already on the circuit:I specialized in theory das and ks, but have lots of experience innovating phil and larp/policy positions as well. Whether you are looking to understand the literature behind a dense kritik or learn how to do a 1AR vs 7 off, I can help! Reach out for any more details about argumentative specifics.In Conclusion:Beyond my debate and coaching experience I want to emphasize coaching goes beyond that. While my debaters certainly will sharpen their debate skills, I emphasize even more importantly the value of presentation, conversation, and research skills debate teaches, which have benefited other aspects of my life such as academics and organization. Additionally, I encourage debaters to learn more about politics and form their own opinions and develop critical thinking skills to help make the ideas they persuade others of are good ones. I care about the emotional wellbeing of the debaters I coach, and will modify drill schedules around mental health and help coach students through tough losses.Sorry I know the pitch is long feel free to read as little or much I just want you to have access to info about me before making your decision about coaching, and if you are on the fence I recommend you reach out to students and organizations I've worked with or are working with for more information about my coaching style.Here are some emails, reach out to me if you want more.Sarah Zheng from Dulles pandazh13@gmail.comLukas Krause from Mitty lukrauwork@gmail.comOlivia He from Quarry Lane oxh38389@gmail.comDirector of LD Debate at UTNIF sunhee.simon@gmail.comODI Admin and Co-Lab Leader for Top Lab pdfox0513@gmail.comDirector of Triumph triumphdebate@gmail.comManaging Director and Head of HR of Victory Briefs Institute anthony@victorybriefs.comI hope you want to work with me in the future, and best of luck debating!Please reach out to me via pm or zacjudges@gmail.com if interested.I‚Äôm also looking to be hired to judge at any TOC bid distributing tournaments throughout the year so reach out if you need one.

Also on this day, our town voted 122-65 to spend $125k on planning the construction of a new shooting range for local police that will amount to 3.5-5 million dollars.

Corr emphasizes that ‚Äúclassroom and scenario training helps officers understanding WHEN and WHY force should be used.‚Äù (source link below) So as a Lexington youth, I have a right to know why $125,000 are being allocated to creating this plan, instead of non-violent police education and training?

They make no pretense about it. ...There is zero outreach to Christians by Democrats. They are not even trying to get our vote, and gave up trying years ago.

Back to the issue of cognitive decline. Below are his actual words as he addressed the coronavirus. Teleprompter and all. He has embraced the full compliment of socialist evil embedded in the Democrat platform. He wants Beto O‚ÄôRourke to take away our guns. He wants to reinstate laws that oppress Christian bakers and businesses. Not opinion. Things he has just said. He is so desperate to become President that he has vowed to veer left and rally those who support the agendas of Planned Parenthood, the LGBTQ activists, and socialism. He has even made a deal with the other devil, Bernie Sanders. China lied about Covid 19. That was a devastating attack on the United States. Joe Biden has made a career of giving in to the Chinese government. He even sided with them after the pandemic started accusing Trump of racism for stopping flights from China. Attacks from China are only beginning. That of itself makes Biden a disaster and the absolute worst choice. Joe Biden is the consort of Barack Obama, who has consistently been the most hostile President in history toward the Bible. How can you call yourself a Christian and vote for Joe Biden?

"I believe the Pentecostal/Charismatic movement holds the greatest promise of catalyzing a national miracle. Specifically, because of the truth of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals have had the longest unbroken move of God in history. That is until now.  This movement is now weak, disoriented, divided, and rapidly losing relevance. It needs electrode paddles applied to her faintly beating heart. We were done in by our own version of a deep state. ... We were infiltrated. The engine that drove Spirit-filled momentum has been replaced.  A masterstroke of Satan‚Äîdecades in its construction‚Äîworked to weaken many Spirit-filled leaders. Satan fooled leaders into replacing gold with bronze.  And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king‚Äôs house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made. Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king‚Äôs house (1 Kings 14:26).  The devil used craftiness to steal our gold. We removed mass soul-winning through the Holy Spirit. He tossed the bone of getting a big church to drooling leaders. We replaced revival with marketing and well-oiled, business entertainment centers. Grace is supposed to be a catalyst to holiness. A rampant new version of grace grants a license to lead a double life.  New Age nuances led many Spirit-filled Christians into out-of-Bible experiences. Never-never lands where emotional experiences and personal prophecies take supremacy over the Word of God.  The worst mistake was to stop teaching and leading people into the baptism of the Holy Spirit.  Most youth in Spirit-filled churches have never seen a miracle.  The result is an entire generation doesn‚Äôt know what they believe, why they believe it let alone possess authority to share it.  They embody Judges 2:10: ‚ÄúWhen all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel.‚Äù See More","GOD Forgive Us and Restore Us To Your First Intention.

Just a few scriptures to remind us what God says in the Holy Bible about greed.   1 Timothy 6:9(ESV) ""But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many  senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.""... Ecclesiastes 5:10 (NIV) ""Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never  satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless."" Matthew 19:24 (NLT) ""I'll say it again--it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle  than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"" Money is power, influence, and overall wealth. Don't become so enamored with the possibilities money offers that you lose sight of what is truly important. 1 Corinthians 6:10 says that the greedy will not inherit the kingdom of God. Don't trade in your eternal blessing for temporary wealth. Hebrews 13:5 (NIV) ""Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you  have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.'"" 2 Corinthians 9:7 (NIV) ""Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not  reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.""

Before he went, somebody said ‚ÄòHey, you should look at this organization there and take a tour.‚Äô So he goes on this tour, and it‚Äôs an organization that fights child sex trafficking and they do rescues and raids and rehabilitation, and he comes back ruined.   At first, I thought, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do this, it hits too much of a soft spot for me.‚Äô But then I literally couldn‚Äôt sleep at night. It took some time, but after a while, I just realized, ‚ÄòI know it may be sensitive for me, but that makes me more passionate.‚Äô And once my heart broke for it, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I care about the number of people who are getting pulled into the sex trade because it looks glamorous, but really it‚Äôs all a trap. The girls I know who are coming out of it, they are survivors and they are thrivers but it does so much damage to them, to their personhood. So three years ago, we decided to start our own organization that focuses on prevention and intervention in America by focusing on the Christian Church. We‚Äôre called International Saints and Abolitionists (ISA). My goal is to make advocates out of everybody. Everyone wants to stop sex trafficking but no one wants to learn about slavery. I think if people knew really what it is and what our sexual freedom is creating, I think they would question it. I delve into the research side. I interview sex-trafficked survivors so I can figure out what we‚Äôre missing. I‚Äôve met some really awesome people.

"Earlier this year I took a class on the American Revolution with one of my favorite history professors at Western. I learned a lot, and read some great books, but one thing stuck out to me.  Most people know that the Founders did not set out to declare independence. In fact they wanted to try and fix the problems they had with Great Britain, and continue the relationship as British Colonies. At some point however opinions shifted and independence became the preferred option. ...Some historians have said however that this shift was not top down as commonly believed, but bottom up. The average British subjects that had little power, and no political connections were the ones that influenced the people in Philadelphia with power. The PEOPLE finally said that they had enough, and that independence was what they wanted. I‚Äôve heard a lot of people say the American Revolution was thought of and started by the powerful elite, but that is just not right, it was truly a revolution by the people.  On this day when there is so much negativity in this country, remember it‚Äôs origins in the PEOPLE.

"‚ÄúThese are the times that try men's [Citizen‚Äôs] souls.‚Äù  Apt  words from the pen of Revolutionary founder, Thomas Paine.  I guess this isn‚Äôt the first time our land has been in a dicey situation. I speak here as a person who believes that one may bend their knee to only one Master. For me, that Master is the Jesus of the Bible. And, I do place all other allegiances in a far lower category of my existence. At the same time, I am an American citizen, with all the due rights and... responsibilities of one who vows, ‚ÄúI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands.‚Äù I bow to no president. But, I pledge full participation in this experiment in representative democracy that is a full system; greater than any one man. Let me remind all of my friends blue and red, that we are not about a President, but about a big idea and a big experiment (I believe Divinely-inspired experiment), wherein our forefathers sought to create a non-religiously run government, with full religious freedom; a durable form of government with checks and balances to keep it safe from ‚Äúidiot kings and princes‚Äù.  So far, in spite of better and worse presidents, this idea of a representative system that reflects the consent of the governed has proven to have been pretty durable. I urge all colors, politically and otherwise to ‚Äústand in the place where you live‚Äù (thank you REM), yet engage others of different views by seeking understanding, seeking peace, operating in love and mercy. And, by all rights, vote for the people of your choice. Oppose poor ideas, but there is no room, to in any way, assault people for their views. It should be safe to go to any lecture. It should be safe to engage others in conversation, even passionate debate ‚Äì and to do so without fear and with due respect. I don‚Äôt consider myself a coward or one lacking conviction when I call for ‚Äúpeace, love and understanding‚Äù (thank you Mr. Costello). I think this approach to decent civil discourse is our God-given and Constitutional right ‚Äì and even more ‚Äì our duty. If we don‚Äôt change our approach, ‚ÄúI see a bad moon arisin‚Äô‚Äù (Creedence) and to quote Bob Dylan ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a weatherman to see which way the wind blows‚Äù.

"On July 21st, my grandmother passed away. It was hard to see her in so much pain during her last few weeks of life. Sometimes when we would video call her, she could barely stay awake to say hello. Eventually, she was being hydrated, fed, and given oxygen though tubes. However, I hate remembering her like  that. Instead, I choose to remember her for the remarkable woman she was. When I was a child, she came to Texas to visit us. Her and my Lolo Pete took care of us, played wi...th us, and showered us in so much love. I eat my sweet potatoes mashed with butter and cream because that‚Äôs the way she made them for me. She wanted us to be sage and would also watch us when we would swim in the pool, even though my sister and I already knew how to swim. Lola was a large part of my childhood and left me with so many wonderful memories.  During the last few months, Lola would sometimes forget who and my sister were. However, she took the extra effort to speak to my sister and I in English because we couldn‚Äôt speak to her in Ilocano. It warms my heart that even in her old age, she tried hard to connect and communicate with me. The last time I called her, I remember her being very tired and sleepy. Despite that, she still woke up to tell me hello and how much she loved me. Lola always said, ‚Äúlove you todo todo, no preno‚Äù, which roughly translates to ‚ÄúI love you with no brakes‚Äù. She truly loved me, even though I was halfway across the world and couldn‚Äôt see her in person often. Djanaya and I would not be able to make it to the funeral, but we wanted to find some way to honor her memory. We took these photos to have one last memory with our Lola and lit candles in her honor. I wish there are to describe how much I‚Äôm going to miss her and how much I love her. All I can say is, ‚ÄúLola, I love you todo with no preno‚Äù.

"The equation of primarily nonviolent protests for racial justice with ""violent mobs,"" and the vague promise to restore ""law-and-order"" with force, is textbook fascism. Trump, Pence, and their surrogates are trying to convince voters that Trump, a strongman, would be able to round up and jail protesters with military force. The wish that protesters would stay home and that everyone submit to God and country (""Biden hates God,"" or Pence saying ""the election is about whether Ame...rica stays America"") is authoritarian propaganda that enables the paramilitary violence committed by the Proud Boys, or militia members like Kyle Rittinghouse. ""Back the Blue"" groups, whose members use semiautomatic rifles to kill and injure protesters in the name of defending the authorities, are becoming increasingly similar to the German Freikorps, paramilitary units that - with government approval - had beaten and killed Communists after World War One.  Of course, if ""law-and-order"" just means ""Send in the National Guard to hang around in case someone dies, but respect people's First Amendment rights,"" Biden would be doing that if he were president anyway, so there's no evidence he'd make cities ""less safe.""
