"Alex Epstein, the author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, considers the details of the Green New Deal.","Kudos to all the commenters who came before me for pointing out exactly where Prager gets its funding from.  I assume that Jocko will be banging down my door any minute now.... PragerU is funded by oil billionaires, this is blatant propaganda üòÇ. Cole Bell no, it‚Äôs facts. Everything he said was facts. Most people are clueless or willfully ignorant when it comes to energy production ' transmission.Nothing has advanced or bettered the lives of humans more than fossil fuels, ever - it‚Äôs literall‚Ä¶See More.

Dottie Minnich the planet has been around for 7 billion years and has seen many mass extinctions. We are speeding up the process for the next one. This isn‚Äôt a matter of whether the planet will survive, the planet will obviously be fine. It‚Äôs habitability for human life is what‚Äôs coming into question.. Dottie Minnich Literally no scientific source says that. The figure is 4.54 billion, accurate to within 50 million. 7 billion years would make the Earth older than the solar system.. There's a big difference between a threat to the planet itself and a threat to the things living on the planet. And I'm not sure who you think the 'powers that are trying to take over running the USA' are, but when I think about people in the US with too much power, oil billionaires are some of the first people that come to mind, and they're the ones telling you not to worry about climate change.. Shawn Lada - I'd rather not look at AOC.

No seriously, I give you credit for admitting where you were wrong once, but you gotta do it quite a bit more because, well, you're dead wrong. Sandy? Wtf. If you want to know what a couple of fracking billionaires think of the Green New Deal, I suppose watch. But at least know who pays for PragerU's funding.. David Wright or anyone with common sense or knowledge on energy productionü§∑üèª_‚ôÇÔ∏è.... Bruh, you‚Äôre bankrolled by the fracking industry.This is widely available information.. This video goes to prove that the 'smart' and 'highly educated' are infact, not.. Kyle Egelhoff Im literally talking about solar panels being good. I mentioned solar batteries becuase solar panels can have batteries connected to them so they have extra charge for when the sun isn't shining- becuase the video completly ignored the fact that the power generated by solar panels could be stored and used later.. Your house runs on AC current not DC current. You can not store AC current in batteries. The energy in the powerlines are AC because it can travel farther then DC before losing energy. Yes it can be converted between the two, but there is always a loss‚Ä¶See More. Solar panels currently power american homes, I don't know why you are talking about solar panels like they are some impossible dream. This page is literally sponsored by the Koch brothers and other oil barons. PLEASE do your own research and don't trust these grifters.. NO GREEN DEAL..PERIOD... Betty Nana good to see you're keeping an open mind.. Betty Nana which one are you in the photo, the lady with the white hair in the center?. 'The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels' LMAO. Just so everyone knows, most of PragerU's early funding came from Dan and Farris Wilkes. Two brothers who started a fracking company. There is a reason PragerU shills for the fossil fuel industry.. Prager U would support hitler as long as he used fossil fuels at Aushwitz. We don't cotton to folks of the Epstein ilk round these parts no more, take yourself out SIR. bah!  Within ten years we'll be 100 percent wind, and solar!  Ray Kurzweil said so.. Our beaches are eroding and we have lost lots of island nations do to the rising water and sea levels. Aren't yall funded by the Koch Brothers lmao.. The deal with the green new deal is Prager has his head up his ass.. PragerU is funded by fossil fuel billionaires the Wilks brothers. Are you telling me a person whose entire funding is based on fossil fuels is against a plan that moves away from fossil fuels?. The fact that he said nuclear energy is the safest form of energy is actually hilarious I guess they don't know about Chernobyl incident and how it was one of the worst nuclear disaster in human history or how fossil fuels are a leading cause of global‚Ä¶See More.

Oscar Wilhelmy nuclear energy is dangerous it could literally destroy a whole country or a city. It bothers me how people's entire perception of nuclear energy is based primarily on the failures of two or three specific locations: Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011), and Three Mile Island (1979, if you're in the US). France's energy grid is around ‚Ä¶See More. This is how you know Prager is a toxic sellout media outlet!. What ‚Äúmoral case‚Äù for fossil fuels? There is no moral case for fossil fuels. Any relation to the other Epstein?. There are many scientists that don't agree. This is about Obama billions of dollars inestments and all  crap going on today.. They aren't even an educational institute. I see that oil money is being put to good use by ya'll eh?. Some talking head paid by the oil lobby, man I'm so interested on his thoughts on Greene energy and fossil fuels! I can imagine they align with, fossil fuel good green energy bad, even though it's a growing industry. How are you going to power New York City? 10billion wind turbines?! Store the energy in a battery the size of a building?  Nuclear is the future folks!. WE ARE ALREADY  USING RECYCLED MATERIALS FROM THE EARTH THAT WORK PRETTY WELL!. If oil companies are so profitable, why do they STILL need to be subsidized? China is going to be ahead of us because they're moving to better sources of energy faster, while the oil companies in the US fund idiots like  Prager U to spread propaganda and  keep them in business, so they won't have to keep up with the times. They profit short-term, the entire country loses in the long term.. PragerU is not a real university.. Hey all you believe green new deal so much. How many of you want to chip and buy me a Cyber truck. Otherwise im gunna need gas still. I'm just impressed by the mental gymnastics and rhetorical tapdancing on display here. Well, that and this dude's perpetual constipated look.. funny how i see this video just as there‚Äôs floods in mexico, texas, china, and india .... the earth is getting tired of our bullshit. because of people like this we‚Äôre all going to go extinct.. Shilling for the destruction of our planet and extinction of ours and many other species, anything for the almighty dollar, your one true god right?. Hey Prager U where'd'ja get the money for this video?. So CO2 is the reason for longer life expectancy and not modern medicine and a deeper understanding of modern science ü§î seems legit.. Oil companies have time and money to transition into clean energy companies, but they're not going to do that until they sell every drop of oil!. You never know. There was an oil billionaire who said, 'We didn't leave the stone age because we ran out of stone' so there's definitely some trying to get the jump.. You almost have to respect PragerU for this video. Most right wing media propaganda will tell you that rise in co2 levels are a hoax or something like that. But they lean into it. Not only are they rising but that‚Äôs good. It makes ‚Äúglobal greening.‚Äù Don‚Äôt worry about where Florida went, now we grow corn at the North Pole. You win some you lose some.. Daniel Podesta the best lies contain some truth in them.. C'mon, commenters. Do you really think the fracking billionaire-funded organization is intentionally trying to mislead the public? It's not like this is part of a consistent misinformation campaign spearheaded by the very people falsely claiming to be climate experts.Oh wait... https:''features.weather.com'course-climate-misinformation'. In these times when the American right is actually gaining credibility and making intellectually sound arguments against the crazed out left, the right's denial on climate brings all of that credibility back down. We should stop listening to people who take a narrative driven stance, right or left. Listen to people who consistently take a data driven stance. Data = truth.. The data is that Solar and Wind is ineffective and wastes more materials and kills more wildlife respectively.The data is that The Green New Deal has nothing to do with conserving the Environment.. https:''youtu.be'1zrejG-WI3U. Climate deniers are stupid mfers.. A lot of people on here informing us that Prager is funded by oil lobbiests, but no one providing information on why the information is false.. Valerie Cihak I didnt even watch the video and I can summarize it for you. Either they are claiming the science isnt there to prove C02 has an impact on the warming of the earth or humans aren't as responsible for it. Either way it's just propaganda. Conservatives and Libertarians are too goddamned stupid to fact check anything, and expect others to provide them with information they're not interested in, and will refuse to believe no matter how well documented the facts are.. Love getting information from a dude who wrote for the Ayn Rand Institute and was funded by the Koch brothers speaking in a video by a right wing think tank that is funded by fracking billionaires and exists solely to spew corporate propaganda üëçüèª. https:''www.youtube.com'watch?v=VxWYglbtqnQ. Elijah White No one's saying that the world is *literally* going to end in 12 years.The more salient point is that we have a 12 year window to prevent a large amount of warming that will cost us a significant amount of money over the next 100 years.. Idk why everyone thinks this is a great idea this is why so many states always vote red because everytime democrats get in a lot of republicans lose their jobs without a new job in site they should really add the jobs first then start the process of moving people to the new jobs or red will continue to vote red for not only that reason but several more. Lmao why do y'all wanna fight so hard for shitty coal jobs? If you put half that energy into moving forward we'd be much closer to a world of plenty.. Good to see a majority of people don't buy into Prager's bullshit--literal propaganda machine based on nothing but common ignorance's ability to believe whatever pops up on the news feed.. 'Thank you oil daddies for all the oil money! we'll be sure to bash anything close to reigning in your blood thirsty practices'- PragerU. Currently 66 very clueless, or very stupid people laughing at this. He is 100% correct. I work in the energy industry, and I know what it entails. It‚Äôs not as simple as so many brainwashed people think it is. And the climate ‚Äúthreat‚Äù leftists keep talking about is next to nothing - it‚Äôs a manufactured crisis just like every other corrupt Leftist cause.. Shannon Wagner Agenda 21. What about hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and nuclear power? Wind and solar are only 2 options.. Ryan Hathaway it framed the comment about 'no country being even 50%' and led the audience the believe that meant renewable. Two countries have reached 100% renewable but they didn't EXCLUSIVELY use wind and solar. It's just short of being a lie.. Nuclear, geothermal, geomagnetic. You missed a few green energies. Ryan Kish did you actually watch the video? He clearly talks about Nuclear energy and it's part.. Matt Clodfelter meant more towards thorium should have been little more specific.

It is legal...and protected by the First Amendment...and (radically) it supports the police.  Sorry I have to point out the blindingly obvious.... Even though the flag on the right violates the flag code?. Doug Palmer interesting.. Dexter Hendrix , 'you're' not your. And the law is on the books.

Johnny Lindal I didnt come here to argue just to correct someone running their mouth lmao. This is why my family is safe, but cops keep TONS of people safe and do a very selfless job I for one am grateful for them!. Idk. Washington state patrol sue spends a lot of time pulling people of for speeding when they could be doing something about the ferrel citizens in Seattle. Seems like a waste of money to me. Seth that‚Äôs what Washington state patrol is for ü§¶üèª‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe figure out the difference between state patrol, city cops and sheriff‚Äôs before you comment.. No I need to stop getting caught speeding üòâ. Seth Linde makes soo much revenue tho. THeir quotas i mean goals are set so high.. Stop speeding. Ahh yess, political shitposting. Thanks to folks such as yourself in this group, this is what Maple Valley is known for. How disappointing.. Gwen nope we can‚Äôt control people, places or things. People will be whatever they want, he can practice his 1st how ever he chooses, Ive live in this community long before you were alive and a post like this is the least of maple valleys problems. Seth Linde ah I don‚Äôt anymore at this point if I‚Äôm honest. This page is literally a laughing stock to other community groups in different cities. Gwen Dumaran It's not political. It's just the truth.. Gwen Dumaran I meant the ‚Äúbeing able to take pride in your community‚Äù. Gwen Dumaran it also shows how many garbage people moved here so there's that too. Ew. It‚Äôs not defacing the flag.  It would have to be an American flag to be defacing it.  It is not an American flag.  If you want to talk about disrespecting the flag - driving around wit a flag on your truck - when the flag is shredding- that is disredpectful. Jeremy Bigford that is fine - but when they are torn or ripped'shredded that is disrespectsble. Just call them at 2am when a guy tries to come in your house and see how long it takes the cops to get there. Sad truth is that they will come but they come to call a clean up crew or take someone's statement. The only one protecting you is you! I'm not saying we don't need cops but saying that they always protect you is nonsense.. Thomas Geissler so true. Flags are why we are free and safe?Holy cow, go figure!And all along I thought is was Americans from all walks of life that struggled, voted, and acted as individuals and one people for a good life for themselves and a better life for their children.‚Ä¶See More.

Alot of this conversation is funny. hilarious threads...comedy gold...my fav is the guy correcting my punctuation while he swears the flag with a blue stripe is illegal and a disgrace!

"5653. Whoever wrote 5606 I think I know who you are talking about because they dined and dashed on me because I was against the revolution. I was friends with these two girls and one guy freshman year. They asked me what my parents did and I said they both were nurses, and that I was on financial aid. Mind you, my mom is a school nurse and makes nowhere near the amount of hospital nurses.  From then on, they began treating me differently. Suddenly they would hang out without ...me and I know they should talk a lot of shit about how I was rich. One day I ran out of money on my metrocard downtown in a station where there were no machines. I asked if I could borrow a swipe and I would repay them for it. I was cursed out on the middle of the platform because it was apparently rude to offer them money just because they were poor. I didn't understand why it was rude because I would have given anyone the 2.75 and knew nothing about his financial situation. When I said that he told me to stop lying and refused to speak to me on the entire ride home.  A few weeks later, we all went to an all you can eat sushi place in Queens and I was really excited. We went and ate a bunch because it was pretty pricy (like 40 bucks a person) plus some of us got beers too. Both of my female friends decided to go to the bathroom and then I was alone with my guy friend. Things were still weird between us and after a few minutes, he said he was going to check on our other friends. When I offered to go with him, he said I shouldn't because the wait staff needed to know that we didn't dine and dash. So he left and then I was alone at the table to only find out that they all dined and dashed me.  They texted me that they left me with the bill because of how mad my male friend was as a result of the metrocard thing. They mentioned something about how my actions showed that I was against the revolution. I shit you not paying someone back in their minds is anti-communist. It literally made no sense. I tried paying the entire bill which was well over 200 with tip and tax, but my card only had around 80 dollars on it because I had paid for a textbook earlier that day. I had to wait an hour and a half in the restaurant sobbing until my parents could come down from New Jersey and give me the rest of the money. One of them had the audacity to wish me a happy birthday the next week.  I've heard from other people on campus that they've done this kind of stuff to them too. They're fully a group of uneducated people who think they're swindling the rich by actually fucking over their peers, who aren't even wealth. I didn't think people actually did this crap before it happened to me, but apparently they do.","Yo is this real ?. Nigel Telman.

"Homeowners are about to get hit with a big new fee: Starting next month, all home mortgages that are refinanced will have to pay half of 1% of the loan upfront ‚Äî as much as $1,500 for a $300,000 mortgage.","My refinance is already well underway. So hopefully I should be able to avoid this.. Jebadiah Stonewall Bacon - push your LO and processor you get you closed and funded by the end of the month!. You should be good.  If you're just doing a regular refi and have no issues with your paperwork, it shouldn't take more than two weeks to close.. So glad my refinance literally finished today and is being funded on Monday..... I got mine approved last month, thank goodness. Bummer. I was planning on refinancing in the near future. Luckily this will not be a huge barrier for me but it will definitely give me a reason to reconsider moving forward with refinancing.. You already have to pay closing costs when you refinance.. Refinancing for cash out and paying off high interest debt  is also a no win situation with IRS tax laws changed under quiet tax reforms of three years ago.. ‚ÄúAnd they say banks and other lenders are making record profits on refinanced loans, so they don't necessarily have to pass along the added cost to homeowners.‚ÄùThat is hysterical.. Keith Esterly it's not a bug of capitalism, it's a feature.. So don't refinance. Even without the new fee, it takes years to make up the other fees that they always charged, even with a lower rate. Just keep plugging away at the original mortgage.. Debbie Fromer We‚Äôre saving $600 a month by refinancing because rates have changed so, so much since we bought our house. It will take less than 2 years to recoup the cost of the refinance, which was rolled into the loan anyway so we only have to worry about that if we sell in the next 2 years. It can absolutely be worth it.. Debbie Fromer silly you. Are that figures into the spread. You seem like you really don‚Äôt understand simple finance. Spread is what your current all in cost is vs what your new all in cost is. I hate to think you believe yourself capable to advise people on refi.. Debbie Fromer Some people have no other choice right now.. Debbie Fromer I get the feeling you don't really know what you're talking about.. The rates are so low that refinancing helps those who need it the most (by lowering their payments). Refinancing actually makes it more likely they won't need to default, so the reasoning is crap.. Yeah that's not helpful if you already did lol. Debbie Fromer May or may not have been a great deal, but I chose a higher interest rate than offered in order to have the lender credits to cover all closing costs.  I wanted to be ahead from day one.. Debbie Fromer   Why aren‚Äôt the red blooded Mercans with their 2A righteousness not out shooting Mitch an The Donald and anyone else standing in the way of Freedumb ?. Joe Dufour, plus the other bank charges. The $1500 is only one of them.. Mikel Podgursky McLaughlin, what does ‚Äúwalked away with $500 at closing mean?‚Äú Does that mean you only paid $500 in fees to refinance?. not always true....depends on how old the loan is and the rate;. Yes, I shouldnt cut my term nor my rate in half because you told me so. What you're saying is misleading.  It greatly depends on what rate you're paying versus what your new rate will be.  And if you're refi'ing with a trustworthy company, they'll let you know if its worth it financially.  I refi'd last month and went from‚Ä¶See More. as a loan officer...this sucks, but i understand it's because they are expecting lots of foreclosures soon...... So don't let people lower their payments so they might be able to avoid default? Makes total sense üôÑ. Govt supported company raises fees during a pandemic...nothing more American that this.. Well that should be cut into the housing market.. Marty Birch , only on refi‚Äôs.. Marty Birch not if you read the article.. ‚Äúall home mortgages that are refinanced‚Äù. Refinance your car first. My interest went down 1.25% by switching to a local credit union. Plus, the process pushed a payment back a month which means a lot to us ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù.. Such a crock. We‚Äôre not making enough off of you for doing nothing, so if you try to cut into our income, we will find you and charge you. Meanwhile, as your bank, we will provide less service to you as we strive to be more efficient to our shareholder‚Ä¶See More. Now is the time to help ppl, not attach more fees to something they're already paying for. Mortgage Rate down,so they get  money from you , another way. I am so thankful I don‚Äôt have a Mortgage anymore.. It's all for profits. It always has been.. Sounds more like a prepayment penalty....what BS. Aside: are homeowners who are in the market to refinance right now really the people who need relief the most?. Kenny Satterlee it was with the current lender. Carl Beutler  yes!. Carl Beutler refinancing isn‚Äôt relief.. Keith Esterly it can be relief if their payments drop a few hundred dollars.... a matter of individual perspective. Carl Beutler The fee wasn't charged until now.. Ilana Weisel I would say it‚Äôs arguably one of the best parts of Obama‚Äôs TARP initiative were modifications! I hope it worked out for you!. Big deal. Over the life of a 15-30 year mortgage, this fee is a drop in the hat when you actually consider the difference paid between a 4 or 5% interest rate vs. a 2.5 or 3% interest rate.Refinance. While you're at it, refinance to a 15 year.. Kristin Schultz The fee is often required to be paid up front when refinancing. That can be thousands in cash that many people simply don‚Äôt have right now.. Thanks Trump.  You pick only the best people.. So if you have excess money and dont neex a refinance....theyll refinance you. One more knife in the back of the middle and lower class. That's really not that bad considering... even so, I would challenge it in court if it isnt explicitly in the contract. Brian McCarten yeah üëè. Considering what?. Considering most of the country doesnt own a 300,000 house and even if they did 1,500 isnt that much compared to the money saved on the life of the mortgage.... ‚Äú.... Trump administration-appointed regulators at the Federal Housing Finance Agency who approved the new fee.‚Äù. Mari Mari yep, no surprise. Leave it to Trump!. Dang!  Looks like we refi'd just in time!  Closed about a month ago.  Got a nice 2.99 on a 30-year.. Can anyone explain why they aren't saying '.5 % of the loan' and are saying 'half of 1 %'?. Average Americans don't math.. Mark Flanagan false. Please try again.. Nate Sullivan trish better not bump this into September!. Sam Cruz Jr. Will this happen to me?. Matt Grieger. David Bannister. Cammy Donnen. Laura Mast. Sounds like my fee may be around $600? If I did the math correctly?. Jimena Rojas Amurrio something to think about. Let Flor know.. Matthew Fante-Becker. Helen Amodio do you know anything about this?. Closed on Monday and got funds today.   Phew.  Debt consolidation and lower interest rate made this worthwhile.. Welp they're predicting a catastrophe.

"#6742 #13054 *** Important PSA *** If your ""programming"" language uses 1-indexing, it isn't a real programming language. For those of you who won't have financial security when you graduate (i.e. non-CS concentrators), 1-indexing is when you access the first element of some object with some variant of ""object[1]"" (this runs contrary to ""object[0]"" for real programming languages). Don't you even question me about R. That's not even a real language, it's just for bio majors to pretend like they know a thing or two about statistics. Its variable assignment operator is an abomination; its syntax is as if a middle schooler decided then and there that they wanted to create a new programming language. I mean seriously, using x <- 5 rather than x = 5? You're even worse than JavaScript! And I'm going to flip my shit if you bring up MATLAB. Fuck that shitty ass excuse for coding that the ""real engineers"" use. I'm sorry, semicolons aren't just a syntactic thing? Also, stop fucking up my laptop. I'm tired as shit about the computer fans whizzing every 5 minutes while I try to run this thing. I don't give a fuck about all your cool packages with remote-control cars or machine learning - the python packages are simply superior.

UPDATE, comrade is looking to get access to now an updated 2K: 1696.13/2000$ Previous: 150/100$ Hey comrades!!! ^^  A Black comrade of mine is in urgent need of mutual aid in order to help survive the persistent violent conditions of antiBlackness and capital. This aid is urgent. Its urgent not only because in the abstract it would help secure matierals which are nessecary for life for my comrade (food, water, transportation, etc), but also more trenchantly, because this aid is nessecary in order to support their continual resistance to the genocidal conditions of antiBlack violence which are constantly conferred onto them. AntiBlackness accumulates matierality for white and/or non-Black people through exporting gratutious violence against Blackness. This means for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, the matierality that we have (regardless of how much) is indivisibly tied to the rendering fungible, dispossession, and eradication of Blackness that is integral to the antagonism of antiBlackness. Given this, and as one small piece in the larger nessecary commitment to aiding Black liberation, it means that for those of us who are white and/or non-Black, we must redistribute the matierality that we have back to Black people by any means nessecary!!! My comrade is in need, so lets get to this!!! It is absolutely nessecary!!! ‚úä‚úä‚úä my comrade has asked that if you do have the ability to give, that you should direct it to my Cashapp (which I will then transfer to them) at: $schizobitch  You can also send monetary aid to their GFM, which is: https://www.gofundme.com/f/vytsdd-kemp-family‚Ä¶ If you can or cant aid matierally, please boost and share!!!","I love you so much, my girlfriend",[],[],[],['love'],i love you so much my girlfriend,{'girlfriend': {'score': 6.9604897428085515}}

are you ready to get him out this is the way forward biden harris 2020 margarita oguilve who destroyed the isis caliphate who reduced food stamp rolls by 7 million americans who had more americans working than any time in our history who renegotiated a tri lateral agreement called nafta who got israel and the uae to sign a treaty to normalize relations and stop sovereign claims to palestine for gods sake get over it she lost move on just make sure trump is not reelected or we are all screwed i would say rather that her nomination is a cause for hope let us just focus on the scary alternative and consequences we face accept the reality and forget the bullshit that we are so offended about lick our wounds and be happy we have a strong candidate in 2020 this time we will be victorious if we get out and vote they are throwing everything at trying to stop us her nomination is one bright spot since trump scarred our nation i fear for the ensuing five months of terror by the brat in chief maureen donnelly agree trumps gotta go but im amused you call biden a strong candidate he is awful and we will be lucky if he pulls it off almost as painful as having modern dna testing refused in the case of kevin cooper in which harris then californias ag refused to grant what an incredibly dreadful titleheadline and article shame on those of you at the atlantic who chose to fan the flames of negativity with this article the amount of time and energy you put into it could have and should have been spent on how amber brejcha fraley i never said she could singlehandedly stop racism i also did not say trumppence is better it is disingenuous to dismiss criticism of her with that harris actively perpetuated mass incarceration and white supremacy when she could have easily chosen not to as da of the most liberal district in the country and then ag of the most liberal state in the country casey stein you have no idea how many people she made sure got second chances suzanne sifri i am absolutely willing to listen if i had my say it would be warren running against trump instead of joe personally i think that a crucial element of women empowerment is ensuring that the women elected to higher offices are good role casey stein while many democrats share your feelings there are 2 things we must take into account what is good for the party and what is good for the country wrestling power away from republicans may seem like a cakewalk or that it should be but it everybody acts like this is such a big deal the vice president is one of the most useless jobs in the united states government all it does is provide a little bit of visibility for the person which is a good thing her beliefspolicies basically do not matter because she will not be in a position of power to act on them unless biden dies or something chris cox the general understanding is that she will be president shortly after the election as biden will be pushed aside due to senility so she is de facto the presidential nominee william james zaragoza there are a very few principled politicians remaining out there shocking i know laura nell until harris calls for zuckerberg koch and gates to be lined up against a wall do not tell me she is far left laura nell you can read about her time as da many on the left are dissatisfied with her role there you are just sharing your opinion i would not say she is any more an opportunist than any other politician you have gotta learn what far left really means it is not kamala harris lemme tell ya hojat musil biden pushed aside due to senility lol what a ridiculous assumption to make what is that based on republicans would turn the hate machine on any candidate not just a woman i am proud of kamala for being brave enough to face it we should be beyond the hillary experience by now it is beyond redundant has anyone forgotten how many women came into the senate and congress kamala would be powerful vp whether a woman or not just as intended i bet these articles were written 6 months ago and they just left out the name of the vp i wonder christine weber hohenshil and spencer i totally agree that is exactly what is happening they just fill in the blanks and spit them out this wound needs to be lanced so that it may heal from within growing pains america get over it it is nice to have a real leader and an actual american in the white house after 8 years of barack odung and his hate america agenda trump train 2020 oh ffs amanda litman needs to put on her big girl pants and grow up this is not 2016 elizabeth anderson this is incredibly patronizing and a losing argument kamala harris is now a trigger warning material for young feminist now _ what unfortunately it may gonna be some even more wounds in november let us all stop moaning and win this thing a poor cupcakes have not stopped crying since 2016 what wounds 2016 was a great year do not worry the only one who needs to worry is mike pence i for brief moment i almost felt sorry for mike pence having to face kamala in debate almost thomas i cannot wait for the debate she will have him cowering in a corner crying for mother within the first five minutes let us hope that trump or pence do not cancel pences debate with harris because of the virus i do not think trump or the senate republicans want that debate to happen they know harris will decimate pence i do look forward though to the debate should it happen thomas wrzalinski yes but those watching the debate for pence will be clutching their pearls or having chest pains because a woman dared speak to a respectable man of authority in such a way and a woman of color at that the rest of us will be giving her standing ovations it will be a culture shifting moment for sure so says the folks who voted for trump lol no it does not she is terrible democratic voters rejected her as phony once the artificial leftist media swooning is over reality will start to grow and most folks will see her as disingenuous staywoke the wounds of running a candidate most of the country did not even like but the party decided vote for her or you are the problem was a viable strategy for oh ffs jesu cristo

"""Schools are essential to the functioning of our society, and that makes teachers essential workers. They should rise to the occasion even if it makes them nervous, just like health-care workers have,"" Kristen McConnell writes.","Please stop posting this. She is wrong. This is wrong. Education is essential. Schools are not. Teachers did not sign on to risk their lives. Nurses signed on to save lives at all costs, even a risk to their own. No comparison. We shouldn't be exposing nurses to unnecessary risk, either.That said, people are in hospitals to save their lives. Grouping people in schools endangers their lives. It isn't worth the risk to anyone.. Saddle Rivera I agree. I know that feeling of unknown these teachers and children are going into. They shouldn‚Äôt be forced to.. Aaron Mikey as a nurse myself I couldn‚Äôt agree with her more ü§∑üèº‚ôÄÔ∏è. Aaron Mikey a nurse has proper PPE. Teachers don't. Nurses have training on how to handle infectious diseases. Teachers don't.. Lisa Anna I think they repost bc they know it's controversial and people will argue resulting in clicks and comments... Also, having teachers not go into schools is more likely to save nurse lives. She's literally making her job harder.. Lisa Anna I agree!. Lisa Anna also lets talk about compensating like an essential worker.. Lisa, The socialization, conflict resolution, brain storming, teamwork development, and physical development kids get in school is something they won‚Äôt get sitting in front of a computer.. ‚Ä¶See More. Aaron Mikey , off course not. Look, this is a personal attention seeking story of two people who want a reality show. Does it even make sense that a nurse who is supposed to be overwhelmed has time to write this, and that a nurse would promote an action that would cause the healthcare units to overload?. Lisa Anna  not true. Nurses were instructed annually in disaster preparation, including adequate PPE & government led response.. Sherisse McLaurin exactly. I‚Äôm so tired of the Hero Teacher narrative.  I teach science to high schoolers.  I can do that adequately without them physically being present.  My students are old enough to stay home alone if necessary, so I do not even provide daycare.  While I enj‚Ä¶See More. Manda Linn amen! We've heard the hero narrative for weeks with my district's reopening push and then saying that we can't call ourselves heroes if we refuse to get back in the classroom. Sick of it.. Great. I'll see one prescreened child at a time, by appointment only, in a completely sterile environment, in full scrubs for 10-15 min then send them home. And the parents can come too, be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it's their turn. I'll see 15 children a day.. So many wonderful people in healthcare. And then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with. They think the whole workforce is to meet their standard. There are many occupations that deserve equal respect‚Ä¶See More. Saddle Rivera When DJT‚Äôs kid goes back to school & when he opens back up the White House then we‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs safe!. I whole heartedly agree...As an RN for 40 years this article made me both sad and angry. This is not a way to promote public heath or support parents in such hard times. This nation has let down BOTH its nurses and its teachers along with every America‚Ä¶See More. James Troutman, I honestly think he'd make his kid go to school like his buddy Putin had his daughter take a 2nd Phase Covid Vaccine. Btw, did Trump's younger brother just die of Covid after Trump had him take the hydroxychloroquine. Just thinkin. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Nick LaCerva she probably doesn't care... Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. üëç... this is just a Trumpie ...NTY gives space to Cotton, Newsweek to that old lawyer and The Atlantic to this nurse .... SAME ..... I‚Äôve been a teacher, healthcare worker now.Stop giving nurses so much attention üòé. Jacki Webb üíØ%. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Andrew Hsieh this. üíØ. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.   If it  is  not  safe  for  football,  theaters,  and  innperson in person meetings,  kids  do  not  need  to  go  to in  person  school.. Angie Johnson Krivchenia True. But the administration wants the economy back rather than safety from COVID. 'It is what it is...' Trump.. So I have been a nurse for over 40 years, still working in a hospital. I know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe.  Teachers are educators and don't need to put their safety at risk and be exposed to Covid, period. Teachers shoul‚Ä¶See More. It's not their work, it's who they work with. Kids and families and all the other people out of the house because schools are open (so parents can work) and in risk of infection. A nurse just stays in hospital waiting for sick people to go to them. Even in lockdown.. I guess that nurse wants to keep ‚Äúdoing her job‚Äù because kids going to school is going to make more sick patients.. Also, that‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve heard.. I kinda feel sorry for her husband.. The difference is that Nurses save lives when they show up to work. Teachers coming in will cause more people to end up at the hospital. How does that help you, Nurse?. You chose healthcare and the potential risk that came with it. Teachers chose education and the lower risk of being exposed to kids with sniffles. Big difference.. Said what I said... this is a cold human being PERIOD. Cant compare nurses with teachers. THATS the point..... Hess Reunion umm I never attended the university of Phoenix. I have a masters in special education and a license in elementary, alternative and secondary social studies. What‚Äôs your point.. Hess Reunion and I‚Äôm a NP.....I‚Äôd also like to know your point?. Anthony Jason Warren I don‚Äôt disagree. At least they are only having brief interactions...but still.. Leigh Taylor haters are gonna hate... Let‚Äôs pay teachers what nurses and doctors make first, and then we can have this discussion. Also let‚Äôs make sure teachers have other staff to do all the cleaning too, and then again, we can have that discussion.. Hardly, there is liability in every job and because of that, you get trained to deal with that liability. People who choose to work in 'dangerous' professions, know what they are signing up for when they enrolled in school. Teaching is not meant to be ‚Ä¶See More. Schools are not funded like hospitals.  Ours is not air-conditioned, with poor air circulation, no way to social distance and in a small space for 7 hours I a day with little kids who may or may not be wearing a mask. Nurses keep people alive. In person school isn't worth anyone's life. Not teachers ', not students', not parents', not grandparents'.. As a nurse, people rely on you to help them get better when they're sick. In other words: if you don't do your job, they might die and they have to see you in person in order for you to help them. You cannot treat people for Covid-19 remotely.As a tea‚Ä¶See More. Bullshit. The kids aren't in going to school because their lives are in danger. In fact, going to school can and WILL put their lives at risk, and especially the teachers. The teachers' efforts aren't saving the lives of their students.Also... PPE...‚Ä¶See More. and just in case anyone thinks kids aren't at risk, we've already had multiple outbreaks around the country because of KIDS! Kids going to camp, kids going back to school, kids doing sports... This is the most absurd argument for public health I've ever heard in my life!. And patients aren't grouped together in one room. Can you imagine having 20 patients in one room and trying to keep them from being exposed to each other.  And kids aren't in bed they're up running around. There is no comparison.. They should be given the proper tools to do their job. Historically, this has not happened.. The Atlantic we‚Äôre in the midst of a public health emergency and y‚Äôall look like clowns publishing this opinion-based nonsense. signed, a covid icu nurse who doesn‚Äôt want to risk unnecessary exposure for teachers and families. See the thing is, she *chose* the healthcare field knowing the risk of exposure to communicable diseases; teachers chose the field of education to *educate* people.  The thing about opinions is that they are like assholes...everybody has one...and some actually *are* one.  Let me guess...she‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúnurses‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt believe in vaccines and has an essential oil for everything üôÑ. Kristin Humbles so by her (mis)logic, I would be led to assume that nurse who care for children who are hospitalized also teach whatever lessons their classmates are being taught in school that day.. Kristin Humbles it is.. Ron it is the comment section after all ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è. ...wtf, so everyone needs to expose themselves to the risk of sacrificing themselves or family members for the good of the masses?. Teachers can teach remotely. Nurses generally need to be in the company of patients.. No. Health care workers agreed to work in health care. Teachers did not.. So you, as a nurse, can be overwhelmed again? Logic? You do realize nothing about the virus has changed, right?. a teachers job is not to put their lives on the line bc a country doesn't have adequate familial support to allow people to quit their jobs and shelter in their house with their families. jesus america is scary. The issue is not only are teachers and other staff ‚Äîand their families-exposed to a potentially deadly illnesss but so are schoolchildren‚Äîand their families.  And anyone who comes into contact with them.  What the nation needs now is a nation wide stay‚Ä¶See More. I don't want my kids to go to school. I'll deal with the distance learning. Schools can't seem to manage bullying. Imagine bullying by exposing kids to Covid? Teachers can teach through Zoom ... Protect themselves as well ... & I am a healthcare worker. How many nurses, doctors and staff died? People have to go to hospitals. Kids don't have to go to a building in a crowd and become little carriers.. Can a nurse do their job remotely? Regrettably, no. There are jobs that most be done in person.Teaching can be done online. ‚ÄúYou gotta do it because I had to do it.‚Äù is lazy thinking.. I signed up to teach kids.

overwhelmed again logic you do realize nothing about the virus has changed right a teachers job is not to put their lives on the line bc a country does not have adequate familial support to allow people to quit their jobs and shelter in their house with their families jesus america is scary the issue is not only are teachers and other staff and their families exposed to a potentially deadly illnesss but so are schoolchildren and their families and anyone who comes into contact with them what the nation needs now is a nation wide i do not want my kids to go to school i will deal with the distance learning schools cannot seem to manage bullying imagine bullying by exposing kids to covid teachers can teach through zoom protect themselves as well i am a healthcare worker how many nurses doctors and staff died people have to go to hospitals kids do not have to go to a building in a crowd and become little carriers can a nurse do their job remotely regrettably no there are jobs that most be done in person teaching can be done online you gotta do it because i had to do it is lazy thinking i signed up to teach kids a nurse signs up to work with sick people enough said

The Trump administration plans to withdraw William Perry Pendley as its nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management. Pendley has faced criticism for past statements in support of selling off federal public land.,"his nominees are always the antithesis of what they are charged to oversee and protect.  Always.. Catherine, that‚Äôs his idea, destroy from Within.  DeVos is a clear example.. Destructionists. yep, look at Dejoy and Devos.. Jerry JB I agree Jerry. It‚Äôs going to take a long time to undo the damage, if that‚Äôs possible. I was an NRA member and took Hunter Safety courses. Now it‚Äôs all about the Benjamins. Pretty sad.. Catherine Howard exactly. Yes. I wonder why only this time, the criticism caused a withdrawal.. Catherine Howard Deconstruction is still the plan.. Jerry JB completely agree.. TRUE!! In fact...they are there to DESTROY  what their in charge of!! Every one of them!!. Justin Parton true that.. Catherine Howard That's a fact! He is evil!. Catherine Howard ALWAYS. Well said. Catherine Howard absolutely true. And his idea of protect means: make money off of.... Justin Parton Correct, hunting and hunters fund a large portion of conservation efforts.  Not all hunters are crazy MAGA 2nd Amendment nuts.  For a lot of people in this country, hunting is an important tradition and equates to spending time with and learning from family.  As long as you‚Äôre responsible and respectful, hunting can be seen as more respectable than just buying slaughter house fodder.. Catherine Howard   always. Catherine Howard It‚Äôs almost like him and his followers hate America.. Jerry JB I have yet to meet ANYONE who didn't have an ancestor who was a hunter. I'm 67 years old. Well, if you break an agency, you can say that it doesn't work and sunset it.. Catherine Howard So true.. Catherine Howard exactly!!!. Catherine Howard Yeah. Like getring one of the most ignorant people he knows to run the Department of Education. What's up with that? Those are the 'very best people' he pledged to help run his administration? Really?. Catherine Howard Cruella DeVilles every one.. Catherine Howard exactly.. Catherine Howard I‚Äôm waiting for him to appoint Farmer John to head the Union of Orthodox Rabbis.. Catherine Howard That is the plan of this administration, to dismantle all the departments and destroy the U.S. as we know it.  That‚Äôs why all the wolves are put in charge of the hen houses.. This is good news but may just mean that he‚Äôs knows he won‚Äôt get approved. Pendley is already acting director so my guess is Trump will keep him on till the end of his term to do as many evil deeds as possible.. Daniel Collay it‚Äôs political theater. Odds are good Trump will lose, so what‚Äôs the point of filling a post for a few months at best?. Which just means he has found someone equally unqualified.. Or worse.. Barbara Havens Joe Exotic?. All public lands and the natural resources therein should first supplement old age pension and public healthcare.  And held in perpeturity  for this purpose.. John Kimball Great idea, try getting current politicians to do it!. This is a start, but he must be REMOVED, and not allowed to remain as acting director. Tell your elected representatives.. Raising hell MATTERS! Keep marching, keep contacting elected officials!. Selling off our federal lands would be a huge mistake‚Ä¶ They are our national heritage and draw tourists from all over the world. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll have a new nominee just as bad if not worse.. For those of us with short memories due to his chaotic leadership, the damage started long before this guy. https:''thehill.com'...'421910-undoing-the-damage-pruitt.... Carol Perry Macholl As I stated earlier, remove ANY politician that has served more than 8 years! Nancy, Chuck, etc. They have already become multimillionaires AT OUR expense.. In not so many months, all of the clown‚Äôs nominations will be in the unemployment line.. Randy Jeffers Who would ‚Äúyour man‚Äù nominate? AOC, Bernie, Omar, Or some other radical fool?. Most likely a legitimate authority on land management. I know, radical, huh? I'm glad you've clarified that stuffing your pockets at the expense of the people is now the mainstream conservative ethos.. Why is Trump even nominating anyone for any position right now? He has no idea whether he‚Äôll have a second term (let‚Äôs hope not). By the time anyone gets confirmed, it would be just about time to vacate their office when Trump gets escorted out of the White House.. What?  He found somebody worse?  Less qualified?  More interested in gutting the land, air, and water than this twit?  Wow!. Kudrun Pilegrim nah, just a bigger donor.... You win. Kudrun Pilegrim no, the guy remains in the job and continues to lead without senate confirmation. Just another end run around congress.. Probably just decided he was needed more over at the USPS.. Melissa Erwin - Nah; He just hasn‚Äôt got to fire anyone yet this month!. Good call! üçäü§° definitely can‚Äôt have someone that could take the spotlight from his citrusy visage, the Divider-in-Chief, Master of Polarization!! ü§£üòÇ. We not gonna talk about how he looks like an alternate reality Joe Exotic....like if he went to college and got an office job..... James A. Barnes yes!. James A. Barnes More like Joe Chaotic.. Yes!. So now they‚Äôre going to find someone else who doesn‚Äôt have easily discoverable statements in support of selling off federal land?. Exactly.  Since when has anybody who left the Trump administration been replaced by somebody more capable and less corrupt than the temporary appointee that couldn't even pass congressional approve if Mitch had been doing his job?. Andrew Chipperfield true. HOW ARE THERE STILL POSITIONS TO NOMINATE?! The term ends in January!. Javier I√±√≥n People said the same thing in 2016.. 4 years later and he still can't get the job done he promised us would be done by April 2017.What a terrible leader.. Most federal agencies are being run by 'acting' appointments because Trump knows he can't get them confirmed.. very different year.. The Trump administration holds the record for the most unfilled positions. Majority is being run by temps. He‚Äôll just hire a guy that thinks the same but hasn‚Äôt talked about it publicly. Don‚Äôt even start to think he‚Äôs changing his mind about selling off land. He‚Äôs just going to sneak it through.. good.  but the fact trump even considered him is yet another reason to VOTE in historical numbers this Nove to remove him.... He must not have donated enough to Donny's campaign.. Jan Moody Garner both sides take lobbyists money silly. Jan Moody Garner. Just another corrupt wealthy Trump supporter put in place to help his own business in exchange for an illegal campaign donation that somehow landed in Trump‚Äôs personal bank account.  The Republican Senate is too impotent to stop it.  Swampy swampy swampy.. This guy looks like the kind of person who would sell federal land. The bollo just completes the reason not to trust him.. Paul and looks oddly like a bleached and mustached Ted Cruz which is eerily grosser.. They should be rethinking about 100 more of his appointments....... Oh by all means don‚Äôt let public criticism of your reign of terror stop you from plundering more irreplaceable public land! Just because your re-election is coming up doesn‚Äôt mean you have to suddenly become responsible!. I would like to leave my share of public lands to my children, so they may enjoy the grandeur of this great nation.  I won't sell.  Raise your hand if you agree. üñê. I‚Äôd walk 1000 miles -to vote them all out in 2020 if I had too. Make sure your friends get to the polls.. He must have come up with someone less qualified or another one of his big donors that he promised a job or Jared. Some people loved the way this guy managed land, and others didn‚Äôt care for it. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll find some more land to manage soon enough.. the real takeaway is that 4 months from the end of his term and he still hasn't even settled on appointees to offices.. Most of his selections to head governmental departments are corporate executives whose track records aren‚Äôt in the best interest of America.  Where as, that dude looks like he‚Äôs from the porn industry.  Specifically, the 70‚Äôs - 80‚Äôs era.. So he pardoned Joe Exotic and gave him a job?. Always thought hunters and fishermen were the ultimate environmentalists.  Sustainability for future generations.

"""Schools are essential to the functioning of our society, and that makes teachers essential workers. They should rise to the occasion even if it makes them nervous, just like health-care workers have,"" Kristen McConnell writes.","Please stop posting this. She is wrong. This is wrong.

It isn't worth the risk to anyone..

Lisa Anna also lets talk about compensating like an essential worker.. Does anyone care about the kids catching this virus? Kids possibly dying? Or their family members? Spreading the disease?

We've heard the hero narrative for weeks with my district's reopening push and then saying that we can't call ourselves heroes if we refuse to get back in the classroom. Sick of it..

Like their convenience is more important than the health and safety of their own kids and us.  I will nev‚Ä¶See More. I don't like the hero title myself as a nurse. It puts a responsibility where it doesn't belong.. Meghan ElizabethYou are so right! So eloquently put! It is disheartening, dehumanizing, emotionally violent, and physically dangerous what much of America is asking; nay, demanding of our teachers right now! It's outrageous and it's wrong. And I suppo‚Ä¶See More. Great. I'll see one prescreened child at a time, by appointment only, in a completely sterile environment, in full scrubs for 10-15 min then send them home. And the parents can come too, be prescreened then wait in their car until they get a text letting them know it's their turn. I'll see 15 children a day.. So many wonderful people in healthcare. And then there are some nurses out there that are just really mean to anyone they can get away with. They think the whole workforce is to meet their standard. There are many occupations that deserve equal respect‚Ä¶See More. Teachers never stopped 'doing their jobs.' And their jobs CAN be done virtually if funded accordingly. A teacher's job is not to maintain public health. The government failed everyone here, with a nonexistent plan for a safe return to school...teachers and schools included.. Does she realize that teachers doing their jobs will only make her job more difficult, and ultimately make her more susceptible to the virus? Isn't her job to stop the virus, and by having teachers go into schools we actively work towards the opposite?. Pretty sh*tty to pit two professions that have been so mistreated during the pandemic against each other. That said, if you‚Äôve never taught in a public school, you have no idea how impossible it is to keep yourself and a classroom full of kids from spreading this virus.. Nurses doing their jobs reduce the severity of the pandemic. In places that have rapid community spread and don't have resources for adequate precautions (i.e. most of the country), teachers doing their jobs increase the severity of the pandemic.. Children  on  the  other  hand,  are  not  essential  workers.   There is absolutely no  need  to   endanger their  lives  for the  economy.   If it  is  not  safe  for  football,  theaters,  and  innperson in person meetings,  kids  do  not  need  to  go  to in  person  school.. So I have been a nurse for over 40 years, still working in a hospital. I know the risks and try to keep both my patients and myself safe.

Kids and families and all the other people out of the house because schools are open (so parents can work) and in risk of infection. A nurse just stays in hospital waiting for sick people to go to them. Even in lockdown.. I guess that nurse wants to keep ‚Äúdoing her job‚Äù because kids going to school is going to make more sick patients.","['compensating', 'actively', 'physically', 'susceptible', 'occupations',

The Trump administration plans to withdraw William Perry Pendley as its nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management. Pendley has faced criticism for past statements in support of selling off federal public land.,"his nominees are always the antithesis of what they are charged to oversee and protect.  Always.. Catherine, that‚Äôs his idea, destroy from Within.  DeVos is a clear example.. Destructionists. yep, look at Dejoy and Devos.. Catherine Howard Scott Pruitt sued the EPA 18 times while he was AG in Oklahoma. That‚Äôs a great resume for Trump. It will take years to undo the damage. Look at who he made Postmaster General. A huge donor to the campaign. The most corrupt administration ever. This guy makes Nixon look like a Cub Scout.. Catherine Howard exactly. Yes. I wonder why only this time, the criticism caused a withdrawal.. Catherine Howard Deconstruction is still the plan.. Randall Bratton , His son Donald Trump Jr probably. He understands how important protecting wildlife and habitats are. He's stopped him from doing damaging stuff in Alaska.. TRUE!! In fact...they are there to DESTROY  what their in charge of!! Every one of them!!. Justin Parton but only  so junior has someplace to kill wildlife.. This is good news but may just mean that he‚Äôs knows he won‚Äôt get approved. Pendley is already acting director so my guess is Trump will keep him on till the end of his term to do as many evil deeds as possible.. Daniel Collay it‚Äôs political theater. Odds are good Trump will lose, so what‚Äôs the point of filling a post for a few months at best?. Which just means he has found someone equally unqualified.. Selling off our federal lands would be a huge mistake‚Ä¶ They are our national heritage and draw tourists from all over the world. All public lands and the natural resources therein should first supplement old age pension and public healthcare.  And held in perpeturity  for this purpose.. This is a start, but he must be REMOVED, and not allowed to remain as acting director. Tell your elected representatives.. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll have a new nominee just as bad if not worse..

"What lesson can we learn from pandemics throughout history? Don't miss the exclusive conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser, and other experts from National Geographic and ABC News TODAY at 1pm ET. Register here: https://on.natgeo.com/3gWJHAj","It‚Äôs amazing how poorly understood Science and the scientific method is to the majority of US Citizens.Science is not instant, it‚Äôs not perfect and it changes as we learn more. THAT does not mean that there is a conspiracy or that there is ill-intent.We take an oath to ‚ÄúFirst, Do No Harm‚Äù.‚Ä¶See More. Mari Machado yet they claim to be the 'bestest' nation in the world...hypocrisy at its finest.. It's not amazing, it's intentional.

As early as when I was in college, people still respected scientists and admired the highly educated, and WANTED TO BE EDUCATED THEMSELVES. What the f*ck happened? Nowadays people are experts in their own minds after watching a 3 minute YouTube video....and slamming experts with decades of learning and hard work behind them, like Dr Fauci. It's sad, scary, and frustrating.. So Fauci took that oath too? Doesn‚Äôt look like it. Had no idea so many science illiterate conservatives followed Nat Geo...ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è. Derek Donnell , herd immunity.  See we believe in real science not the BS you say will work. But keep trying. Robert D Clarkson may I ask what university your degree in virology is from?. Colin Babb 100% a bot. Robert D Clarkson believe? Science is the oposite of beliefs. Follow evidence where they lead and not ignoring them in order to support what you want things to be. There is no beliefs in science, we follow evidences. And you swallow youtube stupidity.. The science illiterate are the ones believing the numbers right out the gate...and it's not the conservative.. Derek Donnell laughing at paralyzed children says a lot about your character. I have been following the bill gates foundation for almost a decade. He has committed crimes against humanity. He deserves to burn in hell for the pain and suffering he has caused. Wake up!. Amy Halligan Let me guess.... Trump U. grad?. I had an inkling. NatGeo comment fields are always... interesting.. Derek Donnell And how many did they innoculate?. Let me guess, you believe men have periods too don't you...yay science. Look at the numbers instead of opinion pieces.. Derek Donnell I was just thinking the same thing. And the views are staggeringly paranoid and illogical.. Amy Halligan, and the League of Stupid Women.. Here you go with trying to link conservatism with illiteracy as well as ability to perceive when the govt is bullshitting you.. Patrick Anwandter what no retort? Yeah that's what I thought - typical cowardice from a gaslighting astroturfing shill. Derek Donnell I actually agree with Alex here since many think Science only happens in school and not in real life, so they refuse to accept what's happening.. Robert D Clarkson 50 to 83% population infection to reach the herd immunity threshold for Covid19.. Derek Donnell They think the follow makes them vicariously knowledgeable and scientific while not even understanding the words I just typed.. Amy Halligan. Derek Donnell says a liberal who believes everything he‚Äôs told.. Charley Thomas charley you really don‚Äôt know how to think do you. Derek Donnell That's presuming that these comments are by actual human being and not right-mongering bots.. Peter Lasorte  Oh really. That‚Äôs the comment you came back with? Okay Karen. You seem to have the erroneous belief that your ridiculous views amount to something. When in fact they are the feeble musing of a halfwit. Actually that‚Äôs giving you way too much credit. They musing of a product of a sibling union. Have a splendid day. You are a very disappointing. Bet all the girls tell you that.. They seek out things to make themselves angry.  Self-triggering. Derek Donnell they have no lives. Robert Tegarden he went to TrumpU. Peter Lasorte listen  Karen, have you read the Lancet paper re HCQ or are you focusing on articles that support your confirmation bias?. It seems lately that the scientist and mainstream media have been setting the science bar pretty low. I remember a time when it took time to develop a knowledge base for the science. Now the fad'science changes almost daily.. Pavel San-Martinek well I would hope no independent research on a new virus was done the last few years. And again you cannot cook results the same twice. Outside influences change the results, so peer review would make the result invalid.. Tyson Zufelt i do hope the same. At this point, despite I do not believe conspiracies, don‚Äôt know until what point the sides are right or wrong. I guess we will have to wait and see what is next.. Paul Fortier scientific information changes constantly. Love the laugh reactions. Haha, one of the most brilliant scientists in the world who is just trying to do his job. That‚Äôs funny.. Yep, Suzi- you fit the bill.. Stay mad about a laugh emoji Emily EcclesüòÜ Sensitive much honey? üòÜüòò?Have a fear filled day.üòò. Suzi Wheatley is a charming example of what's wrong in America today.. Except he's not though.  Even his own words.. Suzi Wheatley except she isn‚Äôt mad. You seem triggered though. Go lick some doorknobs and toilet seats and show us how brave you are.. Suzi Wheatley what gave you the impression she is mad? No angry emojis as opposed to all of your childish emojis which merely show that you can‚Äôt even construct a decent sentence, let alone have a grown-up conversation. But really, what‚Äôs so funny about a scientist?. Emily Eccles just ignore the morons.. Jadine Sayer and people aren't dying at the rate 'science said humans would' by touching the front of our masks, then touching other stuff that other people who touch the front of their mask go to touch.  If people would really watch what others do you'd never leave your house and have others bring germs to you!. We have learned this guy has changed his mind on every turn. Just like the weather channel they will be more than happy to look out the window to tell you if it's raining.'. Lynette Simonson Knudsen I am not a fan of Impeached Donald trump, but he didn't tell people to drink bleach. He implied bleach kills the virus (which it does).. Lynette Simonson Knudsen Sorry, where did I become a science denier for slating people who don't adapt to evidence?. James R Woodhead science denier much?? Better to drink bleach then?üòâ. Tyson Zufelt Really. Science the first admission was there was no way mask would work at all. What science would change in order for you to do an about face on that. My year of qualitative and quantitative analysis was not a waste.. Kenny Drasen there‚Äôs this thing called Trial and Error. Lesson: Use common sense, believe in science rather in a megalomaniacs daily rantweets. Aditya Narayan , herd immunity.  Look it up. It works. Oh wait you can't spread fear with it like the left wants to do. And I see more hate and fear coming out of the left than the right. So you should actually use reL common sense these days.. Wow this is pointless.. Idiots like Robert D Clarkson haven't read a non fiction book on their own accord their entire life. They get their source of informstion from facebook articles and mainstream news. And then callnother people sheep while he baaaaaaaaaaaaaas all over Facebook. Just ignore them. No point. Johnny Mac sheep. Esca Jensen It's a Coronavirus and like any other of its kind it's not going to disappear nor is there a successful Vaccine due to the constant Mutations. I don't believe that we can hide from a virus at some point everyone will be infected.. Esca Jensen before you continue with your bias, one word... Switzerland.. Esca Jensen Glad you realize it. There's no cure for stupidity.. Wow..... I can't believe the amount of NEGATIVITY?! What is that all about? He is the good guy, who had and has to put up of a goverment that doesn't let him do his job..... Matthias Friedrich , this man doesn't know how to do his actual job. He is a fear mongering mouth piece for the liberal left.. Robert D Clarkson. Robert D Clarkson how is telling people to social distance and wear a mask for public safety ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù you‚Äôre smoking crack. Robert D Clarkson anti intellectualism is not an intelligent look.. Matthias Friedrich Funny! I‚Äôve never heard that before. üôÑ And it ‚Äòs my married name because I not a freak of nature or a pervert.. Neda Suhail saying masks aren't necessary is not a 'context.' Especially from one who is supposedly the expert.. Kevin Miller atta boy, Kev!. Kevin Miller That‚Äôs the stupidest comment I have seen. Did you finish school?. Rajesh Singh Did you ever start?. Matthias Friedrich lol... sorry! üòÇ. We all can‚Äôt believe you haven‚Äôt caught on to what happening.. ...people were begging Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act so that we could have masks ; so that we could get ventilators and instead of helping out the United States in our time of need, he was telling people -> 'you don't need a mask, the virus is a hoax, go to work'. Thanks, everybody for responding.... I will make sure to never, ever comment on a post in Facebook ever again..... lol. Matthias Friedrich just some pathetic trump groupies having tantrums. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Michael Anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine. Johnny Mac he graduated from Facebook University. Michael Anthony I think you‚Äôre confusing Fauci with Trump üßê. Hahahahahahahahahaha Fran Tarantella. Johnny Mac yeah ok haha. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. We've learned not to trust this doctor.. Darrell Spurlock Jr.. Found the sheep who hasn't read a book since highschool. Who touts youtube videos, Facebook posts and memes as his information source. And thinks others are sheep LOL.. Dr. QuackNtrump gave us an economy just above the great depression  and 165,000 dead and models are predicting +200,000 dead by election day.  But somehow morons believe it's the fault of the medical professionals.  This would be hilarious if not for the death and suffering and 20 million unemployed Americans.. Apparently him and the rest of his trumpanzees that get their sources from youtube videos. Harry Thu a ‚ÄúMAGA Yell Loudly‚Äù graduate from the University of YouTube is a highly coveted achievement, in some circles!. Robert D Clarkson. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Randy Whetstine is he around anyone outside of his bubble? No this isn't him being hypocritical.. Brittany Golden youve said that everytime, is that all you can add to the conversation. Cassandra Mcdaniel think you mean 'without'. Cassandra Mcdaniel some brain you must have trusting Trumps opinion over the guy who is a million times more qualified.. Spreading fear is not something i see as medical , he should learn how to speak before talks to groups and tells us 'The message is DANGER' like a old gospel revival before the Revivalist releases a bag of snakes in the church and demands faith. I like NATGEO , i don't like people that spread fear.. Exactly what 'fear' are you referring to? He's been trying for months, as additional knowledge is gained, to have Americans, all Americans, protect themselves until a viable vaccine is distributed.. Snake Handling is not a good way to convince people in medicine. You mean like trump spreading fear every time he speaks.. He  knocks  HCQ  because  it  works  and  if  people  took  it  they  wouldn‚Äôt  need  Remdesivir,  which  he  has  a  stake  in. Lisa Flynn go for it what do you have to lose?, chances are you are asymptotic and it‚Äôs just a drug. And then you can tell everyone it saved your life. You sound like you know what‚Äôs going on or maybe a stable genius.. https:''www.euronews.com'...'large-global-study-suggests.... Ahhh.. the LA Times!  I feel better now.. Otro corrupto genocida y falso totalmente, s√≥lo busca el y la oms acabar hasta con un 90% a la poblaci√≥n, sigan idolatrandolos no la de borregos.. Lisa Flynn then he‚Äôs lying. Did he tell you that when you‚Äôre on this drug you have to go for what‚Äôs called a field vision test every six months to check for macular damage? Did he tell you that it can take up to 2 years for the drug to leave your body completely?. Your reasonable, reliable and accurate source for your statement is.....?. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Jadine Sayer I  don‚Äôt  need  it.  I  was  asking  in  case  I  did.  The  people  who  took  HCQ  early  had  almost  immediate relief.  One  of  them  was  fighting  two  types  of  cancer,  took  HCQ  on  a  friday Friday and  was  back  to  work  Monday.  If  you  have  faith  in  ventilators and  vaccines then  stick  with  it.  I  sincerely  hope  they  work  for  you.. The problem is the wrong information that we have from the beginning of this pandemic. The arrogance of the president and the loss souls of the scientific community. Just to please the miss information of the politicians. America proud of my country Spain. We are together in this and we are fighting to have a better way of life. With responsibility.. Wait for the introduction people this is a scientist explaining science and it‚Äôs not the long-haired dude with the ball hat on he‚Äôs just doing the introducing. National Geographic, where are the pictures we love? The indigenous societies we love to discover? The world beauty you show? Who wants a corrupt doctor in a magazine about nature? You suck!!!!!. Give Lisa her pitcher book! üòÇü§£üòÇ. Lisa Beth sniff sniff. Typos and auto correct happen. Im I getting graded on this? Lol. Benedikt Kuhn don‚Äôt be an asshole please. Lisa Beth in other articles, especially in the actual magazine.. Corrupt doctor......ignorant people....this is why we laugh at you. The good doctor, that would be a great idea for a tv show!. Russia isn't experiencing a second wave.Russia has developed a vaccine.Russia is sharing the vaccine with the  rest of the world.Be like Russia: talk less, act more.. What expertise does Bowser bring to the table re pandemics? NatGeo is disgracing itself by providing platform to partisan hacks and politicos. Sure way to lose readership.. Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Carlos Daniel Do you know how to read? My comment questions choice of Bowser. Do some research if you don‚Äôt know who she is. And stop disgracing yourself by ad hominem attacks.. Rajesh Singh you're the one turning it into a political thing, Fauci never took any political side and never tried to turn any of this into politics. People like you are the problem, he's just trying to do what he did all his life, trying to help people.. That the entire government system is corrupt. Including the doctors hospitals any this man on your picture. Curious on how much stock you own in Moderna? So quick to rule out a Russian vaccine. The history of Moderna is an interesting read. Quite the investment company there. Inside trading, poor history of a drug that actually worked. Poor ethics. And majority back by the central bank.. Todd Murphy he Russian vaccine is rushed and not properly tested, they have not released any information come the first two rounds of testing, so yes he feels that it my not be a good vaccine, as you and everyone should.

Congratulations, your stupidity is killing Americans üëè. Mimi Cronin I don‚Äôt know... but I do care for America,. Ted Giannopoulos Exactly. You don't know. But you're more than willing to present your poorly-formed opinion as fact.. ABC and national geographic, is main stream media not experts. How is the mayor of D.C an expert tooü§î. All l know is that pandemics are not new. Humanity have witnessed periodic outbreaks of epidemics and pandemics since the dawn of time. Mankind has endured & we have had huge strides in terms of prevention, scientific advancement, sanitation, treatment and vaccination.. Looking forward to it!. Science is about changes and how we should deal with them. So it's not about changing mind but adapting to what is.. We‚Äôve learned that evil politicians are so quick to politicize anything they see fit to try and destroy an opponent no matter how negative it‚Äôs effects are on the American people.. That we haven't learned anything.. This is ridiculous. Extinction is the only way to stop pandemics. Every species has them, and will until their all dead. Stop treating medicine like magic. Embrace the population reduction.. Stephanie Sarah ok first the world will not be flooded like 'water world' if all the ice shells melt, second the last one in Canada just fell, not the last one in the world. Third if we stay on earth eventually we would be fucked because the sun will e‚Ä¶See More. Tyson Zufelt the earth is way over populated. We dont have a chance. The last ice shelf just fell.

Andres Ruiz , death cult????? Your mind is so warped. Fine wear your mask. I won't. I'll be the one that will see the finish line.. Robert D Clarkson bc wearing a mask is difficult rocket science. Anti-Maskers are in bed with neo Nazis & there is hardly any difference between the two so yeah you are brutally racist redneck scholar.. I wasn't too far off there was I?. Andres Ruiz you must be joking? Masks? Really? I‚Äôve seen hundreds and hundreds of them without masks.. do some research into who funded the wuhan lab. Kellie Dibble. I guess those who posted the haha emoji are know-it-alls or get their info from their cousin who works as assistand hairdresser in East Shrewhampton... Kelly Sweeney I hearted her comment and everything lmao. Shakeela Ameera I am not sure I understand but whether we like it or not science is science. We like it when the doctors save our lives don't we? We like it when science makes our lives comfortable. But we do not like it when it urges us to be responsible citizens.. Love the doctor death picture, its a classic. üíÄ. Why are we afraid of a virus that‚Äôs less deadly than the flu?. Natgeo not classy now, you sold your soul?. Russia Vaccine isn't going to work for Fauci either..   He has nothing invested in that group.... The last RNA vaccine we tried killed so many people we stopped trying.. I bet he's not first in line for it.... Great! A former CEO of Moderna and one of the funders was Epstein. NatGeo is losing the plot. Piss off Disney.

changes as we learn more that does not mean that there is a conspiracy or that there is ill intent we take an oath to first do no harm mari machado yet they claim to be the bestest nation in the world hypocrisy at its finest it is not amazing it is intentional unfortunately americans are distracted by the clown in office to realize a 6x bankrupted con man with over 35k lawsuits pending against him for cheating blue collar workers over 40 sexual accusations against very true mari as early as when i was in college people still respected scientists and admired the highly educated and wanted to be educated themselves what the f ck happened nowadays people are experts in their own minds after watching a 3 minute youtube video and slamming experts with decades of learning and hard work behind them like dr fauci it is sad scary and frustrating so fauci took that oath too does not look like it had no idea so many science illiterate conservatives followed nat geo derek donnell herd immunity see we believe in real science not the bs you say will work but keep trying robert d clarkson may i ask what university your degree in virology is from colin babb 100 a bot robert d clarkson believe science is the oposite of beliefs follow evidence where they lead and not ignoring them in order to support what you want things to be there is no beliefs in science we follow evidences and you swallow youtube stupidity the science illiterate are the ones believing the numbers right out the gate and it is not the conservative derek donnell laughing at paralyzed children says a lot about your character i have been following the bill gates foundation for almost a decade he has committed crimes against humanity he deserves to burn in hell for the pain and suffering he has caused wake up amy halligan let me guess trump u grad i had an inkling natgeo comment fields are always interesting derek donnell and how many did they innoculate let me guess you believe men have periods too do not you yay science look at the numbers instead of opinion pieces derek donnell i was just thinking the same thing and the views are staggeringly paranoid and illogical amy halligan and the league of stupid women here you go with trying to link conservatism with illiteracy as well as ability to perceive when the govt is bullshitting you patrick anwandter what no retort yeah that is what i thought typical cowardice from a gaslighting astroturfing shill derek donnell i actually agree with alex here since many think science only happens in school and not in real life so they refuse to accept what is happening robert d clarkson 50 to 83 population infection to reach the herd immunity threshold for covid19 derek donnell they think the follow makes them vicariously knowledgeable and scientific while not even understanding the words i just typed amy halligan derek donnell says a liberal who believes everything he is told charley thomas charley you really do not know how to think do you derek donnell that is presuming that these comments are by actual human being and not right mongering bots peter lasorte oh really that is the comment you came back with okay karen you seem to have the erroneous belief that your ridiculous views amount to something when in fact they are the feeble musing of a halfwit actually that is giving you way too much credit they musing of a product of a sibling union have a splendid day you are a very disappointing bet all the girls tell you that they seek out things to make themselves angry self triggering derek donnell they have no lives robert tegarden he went to trumpu peter lasorte listen karen have you read the lancet paper re hcq or are you focusing on articles that support your confirmation bias it seems lately that the scientist and mainstream media have been setting the science bar pretty low i remember a time when it took time to develop a knowledge base for the science now the fadscience changes almost daily pavel san martinek well i would hope no independent research on a new virus was done the last few years and again you cannot cook results the same twice outside influences change the results so peer review would make the result invalid tyson zufelt i do hope the same at this point despite i do not believe conspiracies do not know until what point the sides are right or wrong i guess we will have to wait and see what is next paul fortier scientific information changes constantly love the laugh reactions haha one of the most brilliant scientists in the world who is just trying to do his job that is funny yep suzi you fit the bill stay mad about a laugh emoji emily eccles sensitive much honey have a fear filled day suzi wheatley is a charming example of what is wrong in america today except he is not though even his own words suzi wheatley except she is not mad you seem triggered though go lick some doorknobs and toilet seats and show us how brave you are suzi wheatley what gave you the impression she is mad no angry emojis as opposed to all of your childish emojis which merely show that you cannot even construct a decent sentence let alone have a grown up conversation but really what is so funny about a scientist emily eccles just ignore the morons jadine sayer and people are not dying at the rate science said humans would by touching the front of our masks then touching other stuff that other people who touch the front of their mask go to touch if people would really watch what others do you would never leave your house and have others bring germs to you we have learned this guy has changed his mind on every turn just like the weather channel they will be more than happy to look out the window to tell you if it is raining lynette simonson knudsen i am not a fan of impeached donald trump but he did not tell people to drink bleach he implied bleach kills the virus which it does lynette simonson knudsen sorry where did i become a science denier for slating people who do not adapt to evidence james r woodhead science denier much better to drink bleach then tyson zufelt really science the first admission was there was no way mask would work at all what science would change in order for you to do an about face on that my year of qualitative and quantitative analysis was not a waste kenny drasen there is this thing called trial and error lesson use common sense believe in science rather in a megalomaniacs daily rantweets aditya narayan herd immunity look it up it works oh wait you cannot spread fear with it like the left wants to do and i see more hate and fear coming out of the left than the right so you should actually use rel common sense these days wow this is pointless idiots like robert d clarkson have not read a non fiction book on their own accord their entire life they get their source of informstion from facebook articles and mainstream news and then callnother people sheep while he baaaaaaaaaaaaaas all over facebook just ignore them no point johnny mac sheep esca jensen it is a coronavirus and like any other of its kind it is not going to disappear nor is there a successful vaccine due to the constant mutations i do not believe that we can hide from a virus at some point everyone will be infected esca jensen before you continue with your bias one word switzerland esca jensen glad you realize it there is no cure for stupidity wow i cannot believe the amount of negativity what is that all about he is the good guy who had and has to put up of a goverment that does not let him do his job matthias friedrich this man does not know how to do his actual job he is a fear mongering mouth piece for the liberal left robert d clarkson robert d clarkson how is telling people to social distance and wear a mask for public safety fear mongering you are smoking crack robert d clarkson anti intellectualism is not an intelligent look matthias friedrich funny i have never heard that before and it s my married name because i not a freak of nature or a pervert neda suhail saying masks are not necessary is not a context especially from one who is supposedly the expert kevin miller atta boy kev kevin miller that is the stupidest comment i have seen did you finish school rajesh singh did you ever start matthias friedrich lol sorry we all cannot believe you have not caught on to what happening people were begging trump to invoke the defense production act so that we could have masks so that we could get ventilators and instead of helping out the united states in our time of need he was telling people you do not need a mask the virus is a hoax go to work thanks everybody for responding i will make sure to never ever comment on a post in facebook ever again lol matthias friedrich just some pathetic trump groupies having tantrums michael anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine michael anthony should be a picture of trump and that should say hydroxychloroquine johnny mac he graduated from facebook university michael anthony i think you are confusing fauci with trump hahahahahahahahahaha fran tarantella johnny mac yeah ok haha congratulations your stupidity is killing americans we have learned not to trust this doctor darrell spurlock jr found the sheep who has not read a book since highschool who touts youtube videos facebook posts and memes as his information source and thinks others are sheep lol dr quackntrump gave us an economy just above the great depression and 165 000 dead and models are predicting 200 000 dead by election day but somehow morons believe it is the fault of the medical professionals this would be hilarious if not for the death and suffering and 20 million unemployed americans apparently him and the rest of his trumpanzees that get their sources from youtube videos harry thu a maga yell loudly graduate from the university of youtube is a highly coveted achievement in some circles robert d clarkson congratulations your stupidity is killing americans randy whetstine is he around anyone outside of his bubble no this is not him being hypocritical brittany golden youve said that everytime is that all you can add to the conversation cassandra mcdaniel think you mean without cassandra mcdaniel some brain you must have trusting trumps opinion over the guy who is a million times more qualified spreading fear is not something i see as medical he should learn how to speak before talks to groups and tells us the message is danger like a old gospel revival before the revivalist releases a bag of snakes in the church and demands faith i like natgeo i do not like people that spread fear exactly what fear are you referring to he is been trying for months as additional knowledge is gained to have americans all americans protect themselves until a viable vaccine is distributed snake handling is not a good way to convince people in medicine you mean like trump spreading fear every time he speaks he knocks hcq because it works and if people took it they would not need remdesivir which he has a stake in lisa flynn go for it what do you have to lose chances are you are asymptotic and it is just a drug and then you can tell everyone it saved your life you sound like you know what is going on or maybe a stable genius ahhh the la times i feel better now otro corrupto genocida y falso totalmente s lo busca el y la oms acabar hasta con un 90 a la poblaci n sigan idolatrandolos no la de borregos lisa flynn then he is lying did he tell you that when you are on this drug you have to go for what is called a field vision test every six months to check for macular damage did he tell you that it can take up to 2 years for the drug to leave your body completely your reasonable reliable and accurate source for your statement is congratulations your stupidity is killing americans jadine sayer i do not need it i was asking in case i did the people who took hcq early had almost immediate relief one of them was fighting two types of cancer took hcq on a friday friday and was back to work monday if you have faith in ventilators and vaccines then stick with it i sincerely hope they work for you the problem is the wrong information that we have from the beginning of this pandemic the arrogance of the president and the loss souls of the scientific community just to please the miss information of the politicians america proud of my country spain we are together in this and we are fighting to have a better way of life with responsibility wait for the introduction people this is a scientist explaining science and it is not the long haired dude with the ball hat on he is just doing the introducing national geographic where are the pictures we love the indigenous societies we love to discover the world beauty you show who wants a corrupt doctor in a magazine about nature you suck give lisa her pitcher book lisa beth sniff sniff typos and auto correct happen im i getting graded on this lol benedikt kuhn do not be an asshole please lisa beth in other articles especially in the actual magazine corrupt doctor ignorant people this is why we laugh at you the good doctor that would be a great idea for a tv show russia is not experiencing a second wave russia has developed a vaccine russia is sharing the vaccine with the rest of the world be like russia talk less act more what expertise does bowser bring to the table re pandemics natgeo is disgracing itself by providing platform to partisan hacks and politicos sure way to lose readership congratulations your stupidity is killing americans carlos daniel do you know how to read my comment questions choice of bowser do some research if you do not know who she is and stop disgracing yourself by ad hominem attacks rajesh singh you are the one turning it into a political thing fauci never took any political side and never tried to turn any of this into politics people like you are the problem he is just trying to do what he did all his life trying to help people that the entire government system is corrupt including the doctors hospitals any this man on your picture curious on how much stock you own in moderna so quick to rule out a russian vaccine the history of moderna is an interesting read quite the investment company there inside trading poor history of a drug that actually worked poor ethics and majority back by the central bank todd murphy he russian vaccine is rushed and not properly tested they have not released any information come the first two rounds of testing so yes he feels that it my not be

Family Building House in 7 Days ü§©,"Great work üëç‚ù§Ô∏èWhere can i get the design books for wooden houses?. Michael Romany https:''chbanl.ca'...'CMHC-Canadian-Wood-Frame-House.... √âric Lapointe thank you sooo much. Nice fort! I think it's a few months from being a house though.. Built a few of these myself ‚úåüèº. I wonder what it cost to build?. I can hear house building song from rdr2 in the background :D. I always wanted to build a house using the SIP system.  Everything goes together so smoothly. Looks like mostly foam and hardy board. Not sure how the longevity will work out.. That‚Äôs actually pretty cool system but I would like to see how the electrical and plumbing and all of that stuff goes.

Can people safely go out and vote in person this year? Hear from Dr. Fauci and watch the full conversation here: https://on.natgeo.com/2POGNlp,"Yes. If I can go to the grocery, I can go to a polling station. Voting is an ‚Äúessential business.‚Äù And mail-in ballots should be available to ANYONE who is unable or afraid to vote in person.

It does not imply that the criticism is applicable to the paper as a whole.. Selection bias. Of course they say that. The NYT works by selective emphasis. It is comfort food for a certain class. No different than Fox.. Seemed like a pretty straight up honest article to me.. Peter Mark Bockman  Open your other eye. (2% ....Loading) OTHERS SIDE OF THE COIN. Justice Department has destroyed any reason to respect it.. Republicans can no longer keep our economy productive and our country safe. Eddie Bell Jed Marshall The decision you take today determine the future of you and your kids... Don't depend on your monthly salary only, earn weekly from the comfort of your home without stress.https://www.facebook.com/sanjay.ssk.9480. Eddie Bell exactly. That is why we need progressives in charge to change America into a socialist system where everyone has the same amount. We need Democrats to confiscate all wealth, even a single dollar from the poor, and all houses and then redistribute. ‚Ä¶See More. You should claim refugee status and leave.. Because Democrat run cities and states are so safe and well run right now?. Eddie Bell Lol. So, the largest demographic admitted face discriminationü§î.  Because the DOJ failed their suit against Harvard, they're going after Yale.  Obviously, they want the issue before the Supreme Court.  Pathetic.. So the students who made the cut dont care about others who didnt make the cut, solely because they were discriminated against.. Yup.  Gee, a Yale student does not want to say publicly that the school discriminates.  Meanwhile, Yale & Harvard run quotas. not how it works-they think that they are better not luckier -but they are a number of individuals I guess each feels/thinks about this differently. Not all cultures put an equal emphasis on education. Therein lies the problem, possibly.... Just drag the proceedings out to January and then Poof! they will disappear along with Barr.. I really want to have this conversation, starting with legacy admissions.. Yale had better prepare to write a yuuuge settlement check. The administration unlawfully discriminated against Asians and Whites!. Stands to reason that the Barr ‚ÄúJustice Department‚Äù which saw nothing wrong with dismissing charges against Flynn would want to cause division wherever it can.. The FBI's own memo's show that Flynn never 'lied', and now it is also known that the FBI threatened to go after members of Flynn's family on bogus charges if he didn't plead 'guilty.' It's called 'prosecutorial misconduct' ---and the charges against Flynn needed to be dropped for the sake of justice.. Michael Froebe don‚Äôt you mean biggley rather than big-huge. Let me guess you believe in QAnon and pizzagate.. you have the right to believe what ever-but as the prosecutors majorly did wrong-even had he been convicted he would walk-Brady rule is like big-hugeIn that case, the Supreme Court established a rule that prosecutors must disclose ‚ÄúBrady material‚Äù to the defense. The failure to disclose such material is a ‚ÄúBrady violation,‚Äù a violation of the U.S. Constitution.. Mexican American students are not rushing to Yale University. Cute article about kids who will have nothing to worry about in life.. love it.. Love when libs eat their own. Dog eat dog world. Jon Cassett because only Liberals get a higher education?. Amy Dionne they are liberal indoctrination centers now so..... Well duh.  Those are the ones who got it.  Why dont they ask the ones rejected.. You don‚Äôt say..

No squirrel.. https://www.rollingstone.com/.../covid-19-end-of.../. The left eventually eating itself. Oh, come on, this kind of racial discrimination is good, right? Asians are too smart to compete with minorities on a level playing field.. https://actionnetwork.org/.../trumps-postmaster-general.... Hi there. Yawn. Yale is named after Elijah Yale who was a slave owner and trader. ü§∑üèª‚ôÇÔ∏è. Not if he claimed Native/Black/Eskimo ancestry.. M√≠chael Lipko Product of the times... affluent = slave owner. The desperate last stand of old rich whiny white men trying to hold on to power. Stay tuned for red meat every day for the rest of the election cycle.. Diana Corbu not at all....don‚Äôt make excuses for these jerks because THAT is pathetic.. Trump probably got turned down by Yale.. Biard Macguineas And, I‚Äôm the Queen of England.. Biard Macguineas anyone  can  photoshop  anything.. Biard Macguineas No, that's Trump. 'China, can you help me look into Biden for me ?' Who's REALLY in with China so much he was asking them for help?. Biard Macguineas, weird flex dude, but ok.. Deborah Geary Greenstein My Mother used to say that.  I haven't heard it in years.  Thank you.. Rujekipit Brian Wow,  you really do live in Russia! First ever admitted Russian trying desperately to defend the Trump diaster.. Kathe Scott to you that maybe true but he'll be written in the books of history as one of the presidents of the most powerful nation in the world . If he's not better than anyone he wouldn't be a billionaires neither would he have been allowed to step into the white house. It's just unfortunate that this pandemic happened during his tenure. Who knows how the other presidents would have behaved. Rujekipit Brian well what do you know... a Russian troll defending Trump - the most despicable human on earth... Everything Trump has he got by conning and cheating and stealing. I guess he might be remembered as the #1 worst in the world.... Be responsible for your own choice, even if it is not what you want, you have to go on.. https://comb.io/SrnJ6M.gif. The Asians at Yale are cool with Yale discriminating against Asians? Good for them, what do the rejected Asians think about it?. Jim Turner they are smart enough not to take 'divide and conquer' bait. Here's what students think? Here's what gays think...here's what plumbers think..here's what doctors think..... Yale and other ivy league schools don't discriminate Chinese.

in the land grant schools that are public they must have equal standards for all us citizens foreign students are admitted for additional fees they can deny access to these students should they this is an honest to god quote from the article i think this is the oldest tactic in the book to pit minority groups against each other mr shankar 20 now a junior majoring in economics said on friday kelly dossman easy to know who said it it is also true and what the men in power have done in this country since it is inception nobody of course is pitting minority groups against each other and the lawsuit is sound yale indeed does discriminate against whites and asians and in favor of far less qualified blacks far from being the negation of the affirmative action mentality the universitys policy is the very essence of it it stands to reason that1 students who were already admitted have little to complain about in terms of admissions benjamin fan admissions seemed fair to me says the guy who got admitted i do not know enough to form an opinion on yales admissions so i will leave it at that tim daniel sure but that is to get a more complete picture interviewing both those who made it and those who did not make it would make for a well rounded data set you will have students who said i was accepted and everything in the process was just benjamin fan the study did included rejected applicants and was a rounded data set of course many many more are rejected than accepted and i would argue that is why the study concludes that yale discriminates this article focuses on those who dispute the studys findings that is why the quotes are from accepted students only gonna be difficult to get a valid conclusion that is my point benjamin fan students have no issues criticizing their institution while there i have spent 18 years on campuses as student and employee benjamin fan they are not going to to criticize who admitted them into one of the hardest places to get in to you would not think stands to reason that having 20 of asians vs 5 black students seems disproportionated for an american school since the country is comprised of 15 black people and 5 asians jorge andres ramirez many of these are not even citizens having bought millionaires visas to send their kids to american colleges trump is selling the condos and visas jorge andres ramirez what about sports scholarship why is 15 black taking almost 100 in basketball and football scholarship well best of the best or let us start granting sports scholarship to all average fat kids based on population i think the article was rushed not up to usual nytimes standards in its zealousness to prove a point a more thorough article would make a greater attempt to interview both existing yale students and rejected students and compare and contrast their attitudes not just the plaintiffs this result just plays into the reporters confirmation bias ny times is not that high on standards you

Where are you getting that info?. Diane It isn‚Äôt. This person is trolling and/or spreading misinformation.. Cari Page actually , you are wrong . I hear it first hand from nurses and doctors ..

Jackie Roemish we would have exponentially more deaths if that was the case üôÑ. Jackie Roemish there are roughly (very rough estimate) 7,000 deaths per day in the US from various causes. Today is day 227 of the year meaning there have been about 1.5 million deaths in the US from any cause. If all deaths are considered covid related then why isn't the death toll for Covid in the US 1.5 million?. Shelly Marie Dollar Witt it wasnt on this thread but I believe it's on this post-  a woman named tonya share a pic of someone with leg issues and then it says covid related- that's a bit alarming you would think if a death had absolutely nothing to do with covid, then they wouldn't put covid, but I guess not. ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è. Amanda Foy I completely agree with you. I think this happens ALL the time!!  Just like the guy who died from a car crash and was tested later to have it. They said he died from COVID.. Terri Marie I thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake.. Terri Marie I thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake.. Big difference between the words 'With' and 'Of'. IE, He died with Rona not of.. Plus hearing of false 'positives'; the post death test could be one of those.. No one dies from heart attacks or cancer anymore. Tony DeVore Exactly.. We know of a young man who scheduled a test, 2 week's prior to having a SX. Schedules changed, so he didn't show up for the test due to canceling the SX & 2 week's later, he received a letter in three mail telling him that his 'test' came back positive .

Please stop this shit!!! It was terrible to watch and the family still is going through hell. That is how they are keeping control.. Yeah because hospitals get tax kick backs for how many covid cases they deal with so they catagorize as much as they can accordingly. Seth Linde  Which drives numbers up, which feeds panic. The medical system is corrupt through and through but they are not necessarily being diabolical in this case. Hospitals are literally hemoraging money because they cannot perform the elective and ‚Ä¶See More. I can speak from experience... when someone dies, the king county health department (coroner) tests and has been testing everyone for the ‚ÄòRona. Everyone... hence why a gunshot victim or 3 (known) were labeled as Covid deaths even tho they were killed by bullets. Jashawa Scotch yep, even if they are on hospice for any other reason. Maybe we need to compare death rates in the US from 2019 to 2020 to put things in better perspective. The research I did indicated year to year from March through May (not counting accidents) there were 120,000 more deaths this year during that time period. I would love  to see more reporting that puts numbers into a historical perspective. More helpful than just raw data.. Where is the paper proof.   Pull out the death certificates.. Not surprised. They counted anyone with the virus as a Covid death in many places. More money. More panic.More control. ‚Ä¶See More. Kim Olson IQ45 pulled that funding.

that was the case jackie roemish there are roughly very rough estimate 7 000 deaths per day in the us from various causes today is day 227 of the year meaning there have been about 1 5 million deaths in the us from any cause if all deaths are considered covid related then why is not the death toll for covid in the us 1 5 million shelly marie dollar witt it wasnt on this thread but i believe it is on this post a woman named tonya share a pic of someone with leg issues and then it says covid related that is a bit alarming you would think if a death had absolutely nothing to do with covid then they would not put covid but i guess not amanda foy i completely agree with you i think this happens all the time just like the guy who died from a car crash and was tested later to have it they said he died from covid terri marie i thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake terri marie i thought post was pretty stupid but this meme takes the cake big difference between the words with and of ie he died with rona not of plus hearing of false positives the post death test could be one of those no one dies from heart attacks or cancer anymore tony devore exactly we know of a young man who scheduled a test 2 weeks prior to having a sx schedules changed so he did not show up for the test due to canceling the sx 2 weeks later he received a letter in three mail telling him that his test came back positive tonya johnson makes it hard to know what to believe anymore amanda foy yea bunch of bullshhhttt fake virus lmao a really good friend of mine mom died cause of covid19 please stop this shit it was terrible to watch and the family still is going through hell that is how they are keeping control yeah because hospitals get tax kick backs for how many covid cases they deal with so they catagorize as much as they can accordingly seth linde which drives numbers up which feeds panic the medical system is corrupt through and through but they are not necessarily being diabolical in this case hospitals are literally hemoraging money because they cannot perform the elective and i can speak from experience when someone dies the king county health department coroner tests and has been testing everyone for the rona everyone hence why a gunshot victim or 3 known were labeled as covid deaths even tho they were killed by bullets jashawa scotch yep even if they are on hospice for any other reason maybe we need to compare death rates in the us from 2019 to 2020 to put things in better perspective the research i did indicated year to year from march through may not counting accidents there were 120 000 more deaths this year during that time period i would love to see more reporting that puts numbers into a historical perspective more helpful than just raw data where is the paper proof pull out the death certificates not surprised they counted anyone with the virus as a covid death in many places more money more panic more control kim olson iq45 pulled that funding hospitals are not getting kickbacks in fact families are receiving bills up to 70 000,"{'covid': {'score': 50.87033177947585}, 'deaths': {'score': 40.157000178305054}, 'death': {'score':

"Just six months ago, Biden's campaign seemed all but over. Now, he has an 11-point lead over the incumbent president, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Here's how he got to this point:","Pretty straightforward, few were excited for him, same with most of the other candidates, because the democratic party is struggling to stay relevant and their only real strength is in rallying against a disastrous Trump presidency. Still voting for him and kamala though.. We cannot become complacent!  Remember to vote.. Vote shaming wont change a persons mind. Its 100% reasonable for someone who would NEVER vote for Trump or Biden to vote third party or write in. Thats how it works.. Mario Simmons I'd love to return to the legislation that was in place before trump steamrolled it all back with acting directors.. Scott Yep it will be really sad if the Dems lose to him again, to bad they dont want progressive allies.. Mario Simmons you haven‚Äôt been paying attention then. Democrats are pushing for Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, student debt relief, mail in voting during a pandemic, among other initiatives. That is not ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt trump‚Äù, that is a lot of policies that would help the common person in America, not just the 1% and corporations like the Republicans are pushing.. Sue Greenhause no, still very much favor making money for insurances.. Stacie Hall but they aren‚Äôt in court trying to dismantle the affordable care act either. Zane Smith I guess you are fine with Trump staying in power.  Hope the rest of Bernie‚Äôs supporters are smarter than that.. It's more than filling out your ballot. It's making sure it gets to the elections office. I'm delivering mine in person. Early. And then checking to make sure it gets counted.. Oh, I will...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zEkR-D6TnQ. Mario Simmons when asked what he wanted to accomplish in his second term... trump drew a blank. Zane Smith then you‚Äôre voting for tRump.  Nice work!ü§®. Zane Smith I‚Äôm not a fan of splitting the vote. I too would prefer a much more progressive candidate (Warren would be my choice), but by writing in, you‚Äôre giving trump a tiny advantage. I am more against giving trump any advantage than I am for any candidate running against him.. Benjen Sanchez yes, yes, yes!. Benjen Sanchez for Howie Hawkins üëç. Mario Simmons Not gonna argue that there aren't issues with the current lineup, but ;Not Trump' means A LOT. Not Trump means free and fair elections, it means a government and its institutions not being systematically dismantled, it means a stop to the‚Ä¶See More. Mario Simmons If your definition of ‚Äúreasonable ‚Äú includes wasting your vote.  If you want a strong independent party you need to start working diligently six or eight years out, developing candidates, getting them elected, and raising sums of money equivalent to the two major parties. Otherwise a vote for an independent is both naive and an exercise in futility.. Vote Blue, join the cavalry!. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing as in 2016 and expecting different results. Take charge of the moment and fight rather than preaching togetherness. You can‚Äôt bring a divided nation together by losing an election.. Marc JBraunstein , Google: who won the popular vote in 2016, Dingus....The people lost because of some dated rules. It's not going to happen this time around I assure you.. Ric Otero But the electoral college still exists, so the same exact thing is likely to happen again. The democrats need to understand this is an uphill battle in the swing states. I drove by about 3 times more Trump signs than Biden on my way to the st‚Ä¶See More. J√≥zef Joestar II It's interesting listening to early episodes of Pod Save America, a podcast commentary from Obama admin guys, from early 2017. They insist the DNC lost for very specific reasons and they can't use those same tactics or they will suffer the same fate in 2020. All of their reflection has gone to waste.... Ric OteroTo be fair: those dated rules you mentioned haven't actually gone anywhere. Going for a moderate candidate may not have been the best move here. We won't win over any Trump supporters no matter how much we try to compromise with them.. Valerie, sad but true.  Biden offers nothing but 'not Trump.'. Excuse me, but the GOP is running on the exact same platform they used in 2016. Trump is recycling his smear tactic of questioning a candidate's eligibility because of their citizenship. He's still crying 'But her emails!'  He's living in the past with no new plans for the next four years. No one is interested in reruns of his bad four year reality show.. Jason Seow That‚Äôs not entirely true though. Some have figured it out and are not voting for him again. Follow @Trump_Regrets on twitter. It gives me a little bit of hope.. Ric Otero google ‚Äúhow to win a presidential election in the United States‚Äù.. Marc JBraunstein , togetherness is a huge word. It's simple in structure but, so very complicated in action.. Marc JBraunstein this ain't 2016. POLLS SHMOLES. I will only do my vote. Polls mean zip in this election war. There is too much postal chaos trump is initiating.. Shirley Fenile yeah since the last election, you can‚Äôt trust polls. Just yourself and to encourage every non-voter to register to vote!. Shirley Fenile This is going to sound nuts.   Drive or walk to a polling place, bring ID, wait in line, then vote.. David Rout I have mail in 30 yrs. No thx.. I am not sure a pbs/npr poll is a true representation of the American people.  I want Biden to win but I'm not gonna be blindsided like I was last election.  No complacency. Vote.. Oh, he does know the difference,  just prefers to go along with rhe one who speaks what he thinks.. Agree with you on the need to avoid complacency, BUT please study up a little on how polling works. Reputable organizations *sponsor* polls, but don't have anything to do with how they're conducted. NPR/PBS hired experts to do the actual poll. There ar‚Ä¶See More. Don't want to sound like a broken record, but in 2016 all it took was a few 10,000s people in swing states to go 'meh, I'll vote 3rd party or write in to show 'em.' Please, for the sake of the world and the human race we cant afford tantrums like that.. Kelvin Ng well maybe ur party should stop putting forward trash candidates. Ross Caudill just keep laugh reacting my comments bc you have nothing valid to say. We see right through your laugh reacts.. Frank Baker Dempsey trash candidates? Let‚Äôs talk about Trump. I‚Äôm down for more party recognition and support, but not this election....a ramp up in 3rd Party or Independent support this election is a guaranteed win for Trump.  One goal....get Trump out of the White House, and then let 2024 be a free for all election.. Nick Cavaioli There's no need for or else, because we are already there.. Your right Trump 2020. Kelvin Ng it took a lot more people voting for a DC outsider con man because the Dem choice didnt campaign hard in swing states.. Millie Cox That is false. It will be a vote for whom ever I voted for. Hilary lost because she insulted Democrats and didn‚Äôt try to win them over after the primary. She didn‚Äôt inspire people. I voted for her because she wasn‚Äôt Trump, but I didn‚Äôt want ‚Ä¶See More. Kelvin Ng truth, brother. Truth.. Billy Flynn in prison!. Biden is a republican with dementia.. That's why Trump hired kanye with tax payers money. Piss. Off. We have the right NOT to vote for trash candidates. Neither of these candidates represent what I want. 3rd party candidates should be allowed on the debate stages. The Left says a 3rd party vote takes a vote away from Biden; the Right says it takes away a vote from Trump. I'm not going to hold my nose and vote for someone.. Jamison Normand nope vote blue-Biden or you have voted for Trump. Ross Caudill screw you & your petty tantrum. Kelvin Ng and my fear is that's exactly what inexperienced, fed-up, newbie under-20's voters will do by voting for Kanye.. Kelvin Ng - Agreed. In 2016 Clinton had a 10 point lead; look what happened.. Kelvin Ng ‚Äúvote for my party or else‚Äù isn‚Äôt democracy, bro. I don't recall that Biden's campaign seemed 'all but over' 6 months ago.  It is just so important that he is elected...we must continue to support him and work to get everyone out to vote for him.. If he loses its his own fault and the Democratic party's fault. His record is horrible. Im sure 100+ million people will not vote for the presidency. Lois Widener Alworth don't be a libtard.  biden will lose.  Or do you want your grandchildren to suffer the same fate as Cannon in a democrapic run country with criminals running rampant and the police non-existent?. Lois Widener Alworth Right. Biden was the top candidate before he even announced he was running.. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt long and rocky lol. The dnc establishment paved his way for drug him along. It‚Äôs fine. Better than trump.. Adam Campbell you‚Äôre right about the first part. The second part is up for debate. It's very motivational, inspirational, and a lesson for our kids to never give up. That even if you are politician who has spent nearly 50 years in Washington DC and has written legislation that protects big banks over ordinary citizens and crime bills that cause an explosion of incarceration rates for non violent offenses, you are never too old or too senile to become President.. James Sohr - grow up!  If you are for Trump vote for him.  Stop with the obfuscation of your intent will irrelevant comparisons.. Damon Fehler Ah, yes. If you believe that there were other candidates who were far more qualified than Joe Biden you must be a Donald Trump supporter.'If you don't vote for Joe Biden, you ain't a Progressive'. Clarence Walker You‚Äôre right. He should be blaming Mitch McConnell, since he‚Äôs sitting on over 400 bills passed by the House. Also, McConnell is responsible for not removing Trump from office during impeachment. Mitt Romney is the ONLY Republican with a shred of real decency and patriotism.. James Sohr he‚Äôs been in office for over 50 years? And he blames trump cause nothing gets done? What‚Äôs wrong with that picture. Grace Colf they both are, that‚Äôs the joke.. You too can be a pedophile and run for president of the USA (or even be the president!). Jack S Wolfie , trump did that!. He got there by mainstream democrats, not on his own platform. There is nothing inspirational about him.. There is plenty for me. He is not a crazy fascist. That is very important.. Zach Tiemann. Zach Tiemann ‚Äúnot Trump‚Äù is enough for me right now.. At this point any Democrat candidate would have had at least a 11 point lead.. Dave Koltes You can hope, but Joe has been... uniquely steady and reassuring here. He's a known, decent quantity. That might not be the case with other Dems who are more easily demonized.. He‚Äôs a horrible pick for the Dems.  So many more qualified  people out there than this lifetime, career politician.  I‚Äôm embarrassed for the Democratic Party.. Casie McCall Clayton How's he fighting? All he does in whine about how no one likes him and how unfair everything is to him. Trump is a weak joke that has weakened America.. Kim Nickells , he renamed the PRU and moved it to another department.  He was called names for starting the travel ban!  It‚Äôs a pandemic, caused by China.. Casie McCall Clayton I think both parties are actively trying to lower the bar. The next round will have a better candidate than the incumbent for the next few generations.. Wayne Wilkinson - did you think of that all by yourself?  Good job!. Casie McCall Clayton you sound ridiculous too.. Casie McCall Clayton yeah he's a businessman all right. Did you remember how he managed to bankrupt his casinos and frauded students at his university? Or the numerous reports of how he underpaid or didn't pay his workers?He's a businessman all right. Doesn't mean he's a good one, or a good president..

He got to this point by the DNC being sketchy AF, but I guess if the old sang holds true, you can‚Äôt hate the player hate the game. Hope he wins or the world implodes 2020.. Zach Miller are we upset? I‚Äôm wonder how the pussy grabbing, pornstar adulterous, reads like a 3rd grader, temper tantrum man child got into office when the majority of America voted for Hillary Clinton?!?.

Mitchell Fellows so what you really want is Trump again... because that's what voting for Kanye gets... my guess is you're voting for Trump and just being sarcastic... which... is oddly more respectable than actually voting for Kanye.

Rydell Downward Has the flooding hit Cengdu yet?. Forget the polls. Too many people (41.9%) relied on the polls in 2016 and here we are. Put on your masks, wear the comfy shoes, grab your umbrellas, be late for work, leave early from work...If you didn‚Äôt vote last time then address the reason why THIS TIME and please get out there and make sure your voice counts. ‚úÖüá∫üá∏. Jada Love-Loveless i sat it out in 2016 because both Hilary and Trump were garbage but this time i will do whatever it takes to vote for Biden!.

Jada Love-Loveless I am ABSOLUTELY certain with a little basic training your neighborhood food lion cashier could do better than 80% of Congress and the entire white house team.. Polls are so you can let your guard down, thinking your vote don't matter...BUT IT DOES MATTER, GO VOTE..FILL OUT THE ABSENTEE BALLOT REQUEST... RETURN BALLOT ASAP (BEST NOT TO TRUST USPS).

Still ignoring the fact he is in severe cognitive decline?. David Rout Yeah. Plenty to blame on both sides historically and present. Many mistakes.. Yong Park .. Oh lord.. NPR has really sheltered you from reality my friend.. Yong Park Senate blocked Os picks.. David Helms no worse than Trump and more than likely far better relatively speaking.. David Helms yes they are.. That about balances out the Trumpublican/Putin voter obstruction, manipulation, fraud, obfuscation and divisive propaganda campaigns aimed ay Illigitemately stealing another election.  Vote like your life depends on it.  Joe is an honorable compassionate leader who will do his level best to steer the ship of state out of rocky waters.. That‚Äôs because President Obama talked every moderate that was beating him to drop out of the race. The fact that he only has an 11 point lead over Trump perfectly illustrates his ineptitude.. I don‚Äôt even want to know what the poll results are. 538 had Clinton winning by a huge margin right up until election night!. David Leblond That isn't true. 538 consistently warned in the weeks before the election that other media outlets were overestimating Clinton's chances, that the race was tighter than people thought, and that Trump had an electoral college advantage. They had Trump's odds of winning at three in ten which isn't exactly a rare thing.. Yup. 538 had Clinton up by 3.6 percent, and the actual margin was 2.1 percent -- well within all margins of error. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/. Paul Murray exactly it‚Äôs so tiresome this willful ignorance to misunderstand what polls are and mean. It also helps that he hasn‚Äôt had an unscripted interview since 2018.. aww look I hurt its feelings. JD Backberg 11/2017. Kevin Howlett https://youtu.be/JtvGR8UX1L0. And Trump's off script endless video, phone a fox & friend and tweets are proving he needs a padded room. Knock it off! We can see the difference.. David Rout The one who is cheating, again, is worse.. Biden's campaign lacks the energy.  Still hoping he'll win just because he's not Trump, the corrupt, con man who's just looking out for himself.. And if Biden loses they will once again blame everyone BUT themselves for nominating an awful candidate.  The only reason Biden has any chance at all in the general election is Trump.  Imagine how big a lead the Democrats would have if they hadn‚Äôt nominated a ‚Äútransitional president‚Äù.. Alex Gross I'm not a Biden fan, and would vote for a decent Republican over Biden....but I will NEVER give trump my vote... so, Biden it is!! As trump would say... 'what do I have to lose ?' We made it through 4 years of trump... we will survive 4 years of Biden!. Linda Deka My exact same thoughts and feelings!!!. I'll never believe polls again.  Many Trump supporters are too embarrassed to admit they are voting for him.  Vote like you're up against a wannabe dictator who is willing to cheat, cause we are.. Stephanie Striegel The shy or embarrassed Trump voter that doesn't show up in polls is a myth.. Hardy Trenda LaLa right. No one supporting Trump at this point is going to change their mind, but maybe there's enough undecided voters to make a difference.. Paul Murray it‚Äôs hard to imagine any Trump supporter staying silent.. Paul Murray glad to hear it.. Stephanie Striegel agreed!. You're right. Some people don't like trump but are still going to vote for him and they're keep their opinions to themselves. My question is, if you are too embarrassed to openly vote for someone, then why in the heck are you voting for them??. Sue Greenhause Thank you!!!. Vote for your favorite pedophile.  Doesn't matter if it's blue or red you will vote for a pedophile slaves.. Gail Cain me too...every day!  This is definitely the election of our lifetime!. Hardy Trenda LaLa it's funny because he hates everyone, but loves manipulating people to make them think he's our their side.. Stephanie Striegel I agree with you about not trusting polls, but I think it‚Äôs more likely people who voted for Trump before are more likely not to want to admit that and are are either voting for Biden, not voting for president at all, or writing someone in..

This is funny. NPR/PBS does the poll? That‚Äôs not even close to being a non-partisan poll. Why not get the DNC to do the poll?. Tex Gill It's a Marsists poll which is a well respected independent polling company. You'd know that if you did even a smidge of research before commenting.. They're not just calling the people who send them money.  And actually PBS and NPR are not biased.. Clearly you don't understand how polling works. Look into it; it's interesting. Take an introductory measurement and statistics course. For senior citizens like you, they're usually free to audit at a state university or community college, and you don't have to meet the admissions requirements.. Paul Murray Besides Gallup is busy with a new girlfriend.Marist works harder and hasn‚Äôt had a date since 97‚Äô.. Rocky? He was handed the nomination.. LeaAndrea Johnson yes, handed as in won by several million votes. LeaAndrea Johnson the fix was in. The DNC did it last go round to Bernie too.. The voters picked Biden over Bernie; the ones who dropped out would have only diluted both their numbers and prolonged the primary. It was a smart tactical move, and tactical thinking is what we expect of political parties intent on winning elections.. Troy Carpenter So, it was the voters that dropped out and endorsed him a day or so before Super Tuesday?. Troy Carpenter so you agree, the party 'tactically' rigged the election üòÅ. Rocky road? As in ice cream, maybe. They handed him the nomination, despite several debate appearances that left most of us wondering why. A desperate move to stop the progressives. Perhaps they were right. Perhaps Biden will do better against Trump than Sanders would have done. But rocky road? Hardly.. Obama convinced the other candidates who were leading Biden to drop out to stop U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Ryan Cab exactly üëå. NPR reporters getting paid for full articles when the story is one sentence long. Ryan Cab are we reading the same thing? I think the title is referring to looking for Obama‚Äôs endorsement. I don‚Äôt see anything that Obama pressured candidates to drop out. Am I missing something here?.

I hope the Biden campaign doesn‚Äôt get complacent.  The current President will lie, steal, and cheat to win..

Matt Marano Biden and his son set a great standard üòÇ. Alana Bowdridge please try harder.. A shanfully DNC trick to kick out Bernie. Antenor Martin Aleman Ramirez are you saying that Bernie did not pull out of his own choice?. No time to be complacent. There are those debates and the issue of turnout. It is a long time yet and the dangerous part for Biden begins now.. Do not become complacent!  We need every single vote.  We need a Blue Tsunami to let the criminals know they're through.. Biden and the DNC don't. Wayne Wilkinson Your profile indicates that you drink a lot.  That probably explains it.. The DNC screwed Bernie Sanders (again) and handed the nomination to the much inferior candidate Biden.. Everyone else dropped out the night before Super Tuesday - not a very long story üôÑ.

Ian Thomas Dooley yes he is. He's a Republican light centrist that's never done much of anything good in his long career in politics.. Ian Thomas Dooley Incorrect.

rallying against a disastrous trump presidency still voting for him and kamala though we cannot become complacent remember to vote vote shaming wont change a persons mind its 100 reasonable for someone who would never vote for trump or biden to vote third party or write in thats how it works mario simmons i would love to return to the legislation that was in place before trump steamrolled it all back with acting directors scott yep it will be really sad if the dems lose to him again to bad they dont want progressive allies mario simmons you have not been paying attention then democrats are pushing for medicare for all a 15 minimum wage student debt relief mail in voting during a pandemic among other initiatives that is not we are not trump that is a lot of policies that would help the common person in america not just the 1 and corporations like the republicans are pushing sue greenhause no still very much favor making money for insurances stacie hall but they are not in court trying to dismantle the affordable care act either zane smith i guess you are fine with trump staying in power hope the rest of bernies supporters are smarter than that it is more than filling out your ballot it is making sure it gets to the elections office i am delivering mine in person early and then checking to make sure it gets counted oh i will mario simmons when asked what he wanted to accomplish in his second term trump drew a blank zane smith then you are voting for trump nice work zane smith i am not a fan of splitting the vote i too would prefer a much more progressive candidate warren would be my choice but by writing in you are giving trump a tiny advantage i am more against giving trump any advantage than i am for any candidate running against him benjen sanchez yes yes yes benjen sanchez for howie hawkins mario simmons not gonna argue that there are not issues with the current lineup but not trump means a lot not trump means free and fair elections it means a government and its institutions not being systematically dismantled it means a stop to mario simmons if your definition of reasonable includes wasting your vote if you want a strong independent party you need to start working diligently six or eight years out developing candidates getting them elected and raising sums of money equivalent to the two major parties otherwise a vote for an independent is both naive and an exercise in futility vote blue join the cavalry the definition of insanity is doing the same thing as in 2016 and expecting different results take charge of the moment and fight rather than preaching togetherness you cannot bring a divided nation together by losing an election marc jbraunstein google who won the popular vote in 2016 dingus the people lost because of some dated rules it is not going to happen this time around i assure you ric otero but the electoral college still exists so the same exact thing is likely to happen again the democrats need to understand this is an uphill battle in the swing states i drove by about 3 times more trump signs than biden on my way to the j zef joestar ii it is interesting listening to early episodes of pod save america a podcast commentary from obama admin guys from early 2017 they insist the dnc lost for very specific reasons and they cannot use those same tactics or they will suffer the same fate in 2020 all of their reflection has gone to waste ric oteroto be fair those dated rules you mentioned have not actually gone anywhere going for a moderate candidate may not have been the best move here we will not win over any trump supporters no matter how much we try to compromise with them valerie sad but true biden offers nothing but not trump excuse me but the gop is running on the exact same platform they used in 2016 trump is recycling his smear tactic of questioning a candidates eligibility because of their citizenship he is still crying but her emails he is living in the past with no new plans for the next four years no one is interested in reruns of his bad four year reality show jason seow that is not entirely true though some have figured it out and are not voting for him again follow trump_regrets on twitter it gives me a little bit of hope ric otero google how to win a presidential election in the united states marc jbraunstein togetherness is a huge word it is simple in structure but so very complicated in action marc jbraunstein this as not 2016 polls shmoles i will only do my vote polls mean zip in this election war there is too much postal chaos trump is initiating shirley fenile yeah since the last election you cannot trust polls just yourself and to encourage every non voter to register to vote shirley fenile this is going to sound nuts drive or walk to a polling place bring id wait in line then vote david rout i have mail in 30 yrs no thx i am not sure a pbs npr poll is a true representation of the american people i want biden to win but i am not gonna be blindsided like i was last election no complacency vote oh he does know the difference just prefers to go along with rhe one who speaks what he thinks agree with you on the need to avoid complacency but please study up a little on how polling works reputable organizations sponsor polls but do not have anything to do with how they are conducted npr pbs hired experts to do the actual poll there do not want to sound like a broken record but in 2016 all it took was a few 10 000s people in swing states to go meh i will vote 3rd party or write in to show em please for the sake of the world and the human race we cant afford tantrums like that kelvin ng well maybe ur party should stop putting forward trash candidates ross caudill just keep laugh reacting my comments bc you have nothing valid to say we see right through your laugh reacts frank baker dempsey trash candidates let us talk about trump i am down for more party recognition and support but not this election a ramp up in 3rd party or independent support this election is a guaranteed win for trump one goal get trump out of the white house and then let 2024 be a free for all election nick cavaioli there is no need for or else because we are already there your right trump 2020 kelvin ng it took a lot more people voting for a dc outsider con man because the dem choice didnt campaign hard in swing states millie cox that is false it will be a vote for whom ever i voted for hilary lost because she insulted democrats and did not try to win them over after the primary she did not inspire people i voted for her because she was not trump but i did not want kelvin ng truth brother truth billy flynn in prison biden is a republican with dementia that is why trump hired kanye with tax payers money piss off we have the right not to vote for trash candidates neither of these candidates represent what i want 3rd party candidates should be allowed on the debate stages the left says a 3rd party vote takes a vote away from biden the right says it takes away a vote from trump i am not going to hold my nose and vote for someone jamison normand nope vote blue biden or you have voted for trump ross caudill screw you your petty tantrum kelvin ng and my fear is that is exactly what inexperienced fed up newbie under 20s voters will do by voting for kanye kelvin ng agreed in 2016 clinton had a 10 point lead look what happened kelvin ng vote for my party or else is not democracy bro i do not recall that bidens campaign seemed all but over 6 months ago it is just so important that he is elected we must continue to support him and work to get everyone out to vote for him if he loses its his own fault and the democratic partys fault his record is horrible im sure 100 million people will not vote for the presidency lois widener alworth do not be a libtard biden will lose or do you want your grandchildren to suffer the same fate as cannon in a democrapic run country with criminals running rampant and the police non existent lois widener alworth right biden was the top candidate before he even announced he was running it is was not long and rocky lol the dnc establishment paved his way for drug him along it is fine better than trump adam campbell you are right about the first part the second part is up for debate it is very motivational inspirational and a lesson for our kids to never give up that even if you are politician who has spent nearly 50 years in washington dc and has written legislation that protects big banks over ordinary citizens and crime bills that cause an explosion of incarceration rates for non violent offenses you are never too old or too senile to become president james sohr grow up if you are for trump vote for him stop with the obfuscation of your intent will irrelevant comparisons damon fehler ah yes if you believe that there were other candidates who were far more qualified than joe biden you must be a donald trump supporter if you do not vote for joe biden you as not a progressive clarence walker you are right he should be blaming mitch mcconnell since he is sitting on over 400 bills passed by the house also mcconnell is responsible for not removing trump from office during impeachment mitt romney is the only republican with a shred of real decency and patriotism james sohr he is been in office for over 50 years and he blames trump cause nothing gets done what is wrong with that picture grace colf they both are that is the joke you too can be a pedophile and run for president of the usa or even be the president jack s wolfie trump did that he got there by mainstream democrats not on his own platform there is nothing inspirational about him there is plenty for me he is not a crazy fascist that is very important zach tiemann zach tiemann not trump is enough for me right now at this point any democrat candidate would have had at least a 11 point lead dave koltes you can hope but joe has been uniquely steady and reassuring here he is a known decent quantity that might not be the case with other dems who are more easily demonized he is a horrible pick for the dems so many more qualified people out there than this lifetime career politician i am embarrassed for the democratic party casie mccall clayton how is he fighting all he does in whine about how no one likes him and how unfair everything is to him trump is a weak joke that has weakened america kim nickells he renamed the pru and moved it to another department he was called names for starting the travel ban it is a pandemic caused by china casie mccall clayton i think both parties are actively trying to lower the bar the next round will have a better candidate than the incumbent for the next few generations wayne wilkinson did you think of that all by yourself good job casie mccall clayton you sound ridiculous too casie mccall clayton yeah he is a businessman all right did you remember how he managed to bankrupt his casinos and frauded students at his university or the numerous reports of how he underpaid or did not pay his workers he is a businessman all right does not mean he is a good one or a good president talk about horrible picks who would have thought a former game show host and failed business man would have been such a horrible failure as president casie mccall clayton you chose a known con man with a history of racism cheating lying filing multiple bankruptcies who has been accused of brags about unwanted sexual advances who thinks the rules dons apply to him who was given a million casie mccall clayton fighting for america exactly how please put the koolaid down casie mccall clayton until there are term limits it will be that way casie mccall clayton this was on a friends page an anguished question from a trump supporter why do liberals think trump supporters are stupid the serious answer heres what the majority of anti trump voters honestly feel about trump supporters en masse casie mccall clayton you think you do not think that is your biggest problem damon fehler you were obviously dropped on your face casie mccall clayton and f k you too casie mccall clayton name just one economic indicator that has improved since trump took office he got to this point by the dnc being sketchy af but i guess if the old sang holds true you cannot hate the player hate the game hope he wins or the world implodes 2020 zach miller are we upset i am wonder how the pussy grabbing pornstar adulterous reads like a 3rd grader temper tantrum man child got into office when the majority of america voted for hillary clinton why put the gang back in charge that lied to us all about the aca real cost based healthcare reform was set back a decade just say no to imperialist joe mitchell fellows so what you really want is trump again because that is what voting for kanye gets my guess is you are voting for trump and just being sarcastic which is oddly more respectable than actually voting for kanye because someone in the middle of a mania episode of bi polar disorder is a good choice just wait until the depression part hits i am not bashing people with mental illness but he really needs to stick to his meds he goes off the super deep end without them i feel sorry for him actually mitchell fellows kanye mitchell fellows how is the weather in moscow mitchell fellows god people will never understand the aca as it really was and i am tried off explaining it rydell downward has the flooding hit cengdu yet forget the polls too many people 41 9 relied on the polls in 2016 and here we are put on your masks wear the comfy shoes grab your umbrellas be late for work leave early from work if you did not vote last time then address the reason why this time and please get out there and make sure your voice counts jada love loveless i sat it out in 2016 because both hilary and trump were garbage but this time i will do whatever it takes to vote for biden mike galligan that cashier already had a better sense of morals mike i absolutely agree with you jada love loveless i am absolutely certain with a little basic training your neighborhood food lion cashier could do better than 80 of congress and the entire white house team polls are so you can let your guard down thinking your vote do not matter but it does matter go vote fill out the absentee ballot request return ballot asap best not to trust usps legal and fair voting locations will help call ask questions no such thing as a stupid question rebecca nave cling mail your ballots before november 9th still ignoring the fact he is in severe cognitive decline david rout yeah plenty to blame on both sides historically and present many mistakes yong park oh lord npr has really sheltered you from reality my friend yong park senate blocked os picks david helms no worse than trump and more than likely far better relatively speaking david helms yes they are that about balances out the trumpublican putin voter obstruction manipulation fraud obfuscation and divisive propaganda campaigns aimed ay illigitemately stealing another election vote like your life depends on it joe is an honorable compassionate leader who will do his level best to steer the ship of state out of rocky waters that is because president obama talked every moderate that was beating him to drop out of the race the fact that he only has an 11 point lead over trump perfectly illustrates his ineptitude i do not even want to know what the poll results are 538 had clinton winning by a huge margin right up until election night david leblond that is not true 538 consistently warned in the weeks before the election that other media outlets were overestimating clintons chances that the race was tighter than people thought and that trump had an electoral college advantage they had trumps odds of winning at three in ten which is not exactly a rare thing yup 538 had clinton up by 3 6 percent and the actual margin was 2 1 percent well within all margins of error paul murray exactly it is so tiresome this willful ignorance to misunderstand what polls are and mean it also helps that he has not had an unscripted interview since 2018 aww look i hurt its feelings jd backberg 11 2017 kevin howlett and trumps off script endless video phone a fox friend and tweets are proving he needs a padded room knock it off we can see the difference david rout the one who is cheating again is worse bidens campaign lacks the energy still hoping he will win just because he is not trump the corrupt con man who is just looking out for himself and if biden loses they will once again blame everyone but themselves for nominating an awful candidate the only reason biden has any chance at all in the general election is trump imagine how big a lead the democrats would have if they had not nominated a transitional president alex gross i am not a biden fan and would vote for a decent republican over biden but i will never give trump my vote so biden it is as trump would say what do i have to lose we made it through 4 years of trump we will survive 4 years of biden linda deka my exact same thoughts and feelings i will never believe polls again many trump supporters are too embarrassed to admit they are voting for him vote like you are up against a wannabe dictator who is willing to cheat cause we are stephanie striegel the shy or embarrassed trump voter that does not show up in polls is a myth hardy trenda lala right no one supporting trump at this point is going to change their mind but maybe there is enough undecided voters to make a difference paul murray it is hard to imagine any trump supporter staying silent paul murray glad to hear it stephanie striegel agreed you are right some people do not like trump but are still going to vote for him and they are keep their opinions to themselves my question is if you are too embarrassed to openly vote for someone then why in the heck are you voting for them sue greenhause thank you vote for your favorite pedophile does not matter if it is blue or red you will vote for a pedophile slaves gail cain me too every day this is definitely the election of our lifetime hardy trenda lala it is funny because he hates everyone but loves manipulating people to make them think he is our their side stephanie striegel i agree with you about not trusting polls but i think it is more likely people who voted for trump before are more likely not to want to admit that and are are either voting for biden not voting for president at all or writing someone in gail cain goes both ways i have family members who unfriended me because i do not share their liberal views not once did i tell them i was right what made them mad is i did not say they were right this is funny npr pbs does the poll that is not even close to being a non partisan poll why not get the dnc to do the poll tex gill it is a marsists poll which is a well respected independent polling company you would know that if you did even a smidge of research before commenting they are not just calling the people who send them money and actually pbs and npr are not biased clearly you do not understand how polling works look into it it is interesting take an introductory measurement and statistics course for senior citizens like you they are usually free to audit at a state university or community college and you do not have to meet the admissions requirements paul murray besides gallup is busy with a new girlfriend marist works harder and has not had a date since 97 rocky he was handed the nomination leaandrea johnson yes handed as in won by several million votes leaandrea johnson the fix was in the dnc did it last go round to bernie too the voters picked biden over bernie the ones who dropped out would have only diluted both their numbers and prolonged the primary it was a smart tactical move and tactical thinking is what we expect of political parties intent on winning elections troy carpenter so it was the voters that dropped out and endorsed him a day or so before super tuesday troy carpenter so you agree the party tactically rigged the election rocky road as in ice cream maybe they handed him the nomination despite several debate appearances that left most of us wondering why a desperate move to stop the progressives perhaps they were right perhaps biden will do better against trump than sanders would have done but rocky road hardly obama convinced the other candidates who were leading biden to drop out to stop u s senator bernie sanders ryan cab exactly npr reporters getting paid for full articles when the story is one sentence long ryan cab are we reading the same thing i think the title is referring to looking for obamas endorsement i do not see anything that obama pressured candidates to drop out am i missing something here michael hollrigel see more i hope the biden campaign does not get complacent the current president will lie steal and cheat to win matt marano even if he does win we must insist there was lying cheating and stealing matt marano he is already lying cheating and stealing matt marano biden and his son set a great standard alana bowdridge please try harder a shanfully dnc trick to kick out bernie antenor martin aleman ramirez are you saying that bernie did not pull out of his own choice no time to be complacent there are those debates and the issue of turnout it is a long time yet and the dangerous part for biden begins now do not become complacent we need every single vote we need a blue tsunami to let the criminals know they are through biden and the dnc do not wayne wilkinson your profile indicates that you drink a lot that probably explains it the dnc screwed bernie sanders again and handed the nomination to the much inferior candidate biden everyone else dropped out the night before super tuesday not a very long story kailee bringedahl great choreography nothing is the same about 2016 bro bro please it is a different election hillary was not polling as well back then bro you gotta vote blue no matter who bro please the democratic establishment is not flagrantly ignoring and diminishing the voices of the left and youth once again it is a different election bro please you just gotta try a different more conservative and pro corporate strain of politician bro please vote blue pedophile they are better than red pedophile chris finestone you should look into the electoral college you seem to misunderstand how all this actually works joe bidens long and rocky road to the nursing home there i fixed it for you general kindness thatll get you pretty far even in todays hate tornado we are all trying to survive because the establishment said it would be biden no matter how unenthusiastic majority of voters where about him progressives knew this before it even started it was not our first rodeo with the dnc after bernie took the early lead in the first hope you are going to vote blue josh christopher rigged bryce evans thank you for that sure i agree with that josh christopher cannot lose to the worst candidate in history if you are the worst candidate in history lmfao keep drinking that kool aid he is the same exact position clinton was in at the same point in 2016 this is not about me in a nice safe coastal state ian thomas dooley huge difference here ian thomas dooley hillary is not running ian thomas dooley yes he is he is a republican light centrist that is never done much of anything good in his long career in politics ian thomas dooley incorrect trump was much closer to clinton in 2016 some polls even had him ahead also clinton had record breaking disapproval ratings for a dem candidate more than 50 bidens is less than 50 it does not matter when election time comes trump will win biden would be a disaster to this county alex lopez why do people put so much into polls hillary had a 16 point lead according to the polls and that meant squat

Matthew Hawn - Like I said, it depends on what you use a passport for.  But thanks for playing. :). Linda Ladwig how many ppl on public assistance have a passport. Trump would only save us individually from a disaster abroad if he had reason to believe we were one of his supporters. Otherwise he‚Äôd throw those of us who aren‚Äôt to the wolves.. Frankly, as a person with only US citizenship, I think Germany might be more likely to rescue me if I got stuck in some foreign country in the middle of a perilous political crisis.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Germany did a very effective military rescue of everyone trapped by the pandemic. Kerry Grittner Military? No. Peter H.

That means they‚Äôre catching up!. Rachel Cecilia Great! My passport will expire in December. I need one for when this Pandemic mess has passed and we can travel again.. Iliahi Freaze get ahead of it, I sent mine in mid-May, 2 weeks before it expired. I just got my new one in the mail yesterday and I'm still waiting for the card version and my expired passport. There's definitely a delay.. Iliahi Freaze Yes. They warned us that there would be a delay, but there ended up not being one.. You need to work on your lineup, Atlantic: you're getting repetitious. Save your recycling for your plastics.. It won‚Äôt be like this forever. This gloom-and-doom isn‚Äôt helpful.. Thank you, President Trump!. Look on the bright side. We got the wall! His supporters don't notice, because they don't leave maw maw's front porch, but to us that travel the world... Oh yeah, he's built the wall.. Actually, I‚Äôm in Albania right now. Just visited the beautiful country of Serbia. Off to Ukraine and Croatia in a few weeks. Everyone has welcomed me with open arms..

"A Japanese cargo ship that ran aground off the coast of Mauritius has split in two. It spilled at least 1,000 tons of oil into the Indian Ocean ‚Äî causing what scientists call the worst ecological disaster in the country's history.","They should clean the area up and mandate funds for a local fish/coral hatchery. Their government doesn't need japans money because they will waste it anyways. Targeted funding.. This year is cursed! This breaks my heart üíî poor marine wildlife and ecosystem. Antonio Liljedahl  oils price are go down now I don‚Äôt like that monopoly not that Great Depression my question is gas electricity is better than oil future.. I want to go help clean up. Is there a group I could contact for that?. Joffroy Berkins I seriously doubt you‚Äôre qualified for a sea cleanup.. I know that I am a useless idiot- but how would you?. We're so over oil. Move on, already! We have the technology. That includes plastics - enough!. Kelly Hite it was a cargo ship; please read the article. The oil/fuel was to use on the ship to move it from place to place. Geez, people are dense.. Brian O'Connor I'm afraid you've missed my point altogether. Perhaps best to refrain calling people dense when you fail to understand the point being made.. *this message brought to you by Samsung Galaxy. A device that is solely composed of strip mined minerals and fossil fuels.. Some alternative fuel sources would be wonderful, it's too bad that windmills cause cancer.. Shawn Nuthall and that solar panels will drain the sun.. Shawn Nuthall should have installed the power generator on each bed. Then we will have massive power generated after every night...Oh no, it will cause earth quake.... Stephen Fowler I was just quoting the orange one... We had a paper mill shut down here where I live... On the river, off the interstate, has it's own rail feed. Talked with windmill manufacturing out of Gainesville TX, asked if they expanded at all, ad‚Ä¶See More. Electromagnetism is your future energy drive, earthlings. Embrace it in its simplicity or count down your inevitable destruction.. Jay Douglas Why not.  The way they reproduce.  Kind of like 'War of the Worlds' with Tom Cruise and those alien machines.. Jay Douglas sorry. Imagine driving your car into public pond or lake and just leaving it there. You'd probably be arrested and fined, but when it comes to oil tankers it's ok because 'you use petroleum products, right ?'. Roxlau Islais it wasn‚Äôt an oil tanker.. Roxlau Islais imaging if people would read an article before commenting.. Japan should take transparent ecological responsibility for this disaster in terms of compensation to that county and individual residents of the local area affected.. Japan... east asia is not all the same place. August Kersten Japan üáØüáµ!. As with many nations of Japan‚Äôs stature in the global community they will no doubt stay silent.. Andy Buck do you demonstrate idiocy every day or only when you don‚Äôt read an article. This is a cargo ship and the company that manages it is doing the cleanup. Perhaps read an article before you demonstrate bigotry and ignorance in the same comment.. Japan is still leaking nuclear waste if I‚Äôm not mistaken.  They continue to wreak havoc Globally..... Breaking: American complains about Japan‚Äôs use of nuclear technology. Lol @ reek. Erik Weston it wasn't the Japanese that made Hiroshima or Nagasaki radioactive.... It‚Äôs not being collected and stored like the stuff at Hanford which leaks a tiny bit as storage tanks degrade. Raquel Leiva Fukushima didn‚Äôt happen??. Raquel Leiva actually it kind of depends on how you look at it- if Japan hadn‚Äôt killed millions of people and tried to take over half of the world- Hiroshima and Nagasaki would not have been bombed.. Ok yeah Japan is slacking, wtf?. Greg Diebold your fundamental lack of historical understanding is a bit disturbing and completely off topic.. Who owns it? I feel like there‚Äôs been a deliberate move away from identifying the owners. Have they even said who actually owns the oil and the ship? Who‚Äôs responsible for cleaning up this oil?. human beings are the worst thing to ever happen to the planet.  the sooner we go extinct the better. There's just no learning when it comes to oil transport.  It's the definition of insanity.. Georgia Willis  that literally is not the definition of insanity. It‚Äôs a misattributed quote from Einstein that can‚Äôt even be validated as Einstein‚Äôs quote... because he didn‚Äôt say it. I really wish it would go away üôÉ. Georgia Willis you‚Äôre awful condescending for someone who didn‚Äôt read the article.. Matt Smolich I don't see Einstein mentioned in Georgia's remark. ü§î. I wouldn‚Äôt care if Japan went bankrupt cleaning up this f@&$)(; mess.. Julie Anne 1. It‚Äôs practically nothing compared to other oil spills. 2. You can‚Äôt clean it up once it disperses.. Julie Anne The boat was registered to a shell company in Panama, so technically  Japan isn't responsible.. Fine and arrest the owner of the ship!!. Josh Bell why? It was an accident, and not a foreseeable one.. How come we haven't taken more precautions for transporting oil? This has happened enough that you would think we'd change our system... anybody have any suggestions? Unfortunately this is out of my scope of practice.. Saige Lucas Castellanos why don‚Äôt you read the article?. Saige Lucas Castellanos they weren‚Äôt transporting oil, it was a cargo ship.  The oil/fuel and hydronic fluid is for the operation of the ship.. David McLeod Because I'm an American and don't read lol jk but for real, I understand accidents happen but we need a new system to prevent incidents like this.. Oil, radioactive material, overfishing... Japan loves the ocean.. Joseph Stark oh a second moronic comment, you‚Äôre 2 for 2, would you like to go for a third?. David McLeod a ship snapping in half is not an accident, it is negligence.... David McLeod rather than resorting to insults, would you explain why it was not a forseeable accident? They choose a poor route through a highly sensitive area they shouldn‚Äôt have been in to begin with.. 'Worst ecological disaster in the country's history' is misleading, since Mauritius has only been a country since 1968. The ship sinkings in the region during the Second World War dwarf this accident by orders of magnitude.. 'Worst ecological disaster' slipped right past you. War is not a 'ecological disaster' . Ralph, oh man, this is what got you all worked up??Priorities buddy.. Nah, it's a slow news day, Tim üòÉ At least I'm not arguing that an ecological disaster is a disaster caused by the environment, or whatever that fool was trying to prove üòÉ. Ronald Auther he‚Äôs talking about all the oil going down with this ships.. Nothing outlasts the destruction of 2020. It keeps going and going and going.... Whoa. Exxon-like malfeasance again. The Valdez spill in Alaska. This is another long enduring horror.. Sacilliyah Yves Walker not even remotely, it was a cargo ship that ran into a reef, not an easily foreseeable or preventable thing.. We all know that fossil fuel is bad but who really cares as long as it run our car and everything we need. Tomorrow we will ship more and more. They weren‚Äôt shipping it as you say, they were using it as fuel, which is currently the only option for moving cargo ships unless you prefer nuclear power. Even then they will have tons of oil-based lubricants and such on board.. David McLeod its a Fuel oil right?. Japan should clean it up ASAP. Such a nuisance leaving it like that!!. Mauritius, for those not keeping track of extinctions, was the home of the Dodo bird. It no longer is, because the Dutch just killed them all after they got there.. There goes all the Amazon delivery vetoes !. If Krammerico had only won their patent.. This is devastating.  The lemon juice in the gaping wound that is 2020.. still, we continue to make the same mistakes over and over again and again,why?. Fabrizio Montanar Profit for some.. Fabrizio Montanar money and convenience. Because no one has locked down the country of origin registration and Panama and Liberia make it so easy.         If it were more difficult,  the cruise ships would actually operate out of their home country and be responsible for their actions.   It's only the environmental disasters that have us question the shipping industry.. We have got to stop using fossil fuel.  Enough of big oil oligarchies.. Joe Morrow the only other option for moving large cargo ships is nuclear if you‚Äôre fine with that.. *Brought to you by Samsung Galaxy. An item that is made up of minerals and fossil fuels. Where‚Äôs the UN! They need to force country like Japan to clean up!. where are the hasmat wearing clean-up crews???????? what phenomenal irresponsibility. the planet is dying from pollution and this???? W T F ?. What does run aground mean? What caused the split and how long did it take to split? Thanks for the info in advance y'all.. Wind and solar would not do that!. Josephine Montoya wind and solar would not move a cargo ship of that size.. To be fair... That is an *awesome* photo.. An ounce of prevention, is worth a pound of cure üò¢. Mauritius depends on the sea, too.. Leave the oil in the ground!!. Send Japan the bill for all associated cost.. Where is the Japanese company  that owns the ship? Can't they launch a recovery and cleanup?. Where is Japan? Why aren't they handling this?. Get ready to foot a BIG bill, Japan.. Japan needs to fix this and give restitition immediately.. all those boats Japan has killing whales 'for science' and they can't even take care of their fleet. Michael Vilabrera dolt. One wonders where allegiances are these days.. But windmills cause cancer. Jamie DeFelice. Jamie DeFelice No, it is blatant Whataboutism, muffin mellons. üòâ. Charles Roberts. Charles Roberts it's satire sugar tits. WTF üáØüáµ clean this disaster up!. How did it leak 1000 tons and they have collected 1250 tons? If they literally collected more than had spilled then how is this a major ecological disaster?  Something is wrong here.. Good that it split!  It will never be able to dump oil again! Japanese ocean polluters!. 2020 - the hits keep coming. The gulf spill has taught us that nature has a way of handling these spills. So Fukushima was what??.. Sara Brown worst ecological disaster in Mauritius' history, not Japan's.. This is why my daughter (20) said she is never having kids. What kind of planet are we leaving for them? 2020 - the hits just keep on coming... üòî. Which country‚Äôs history. Hang them all.

Who the fuck is gonna vote for this?. Leave Ye alone. Taking advantage of someone in the throes of a mental health crisis is disgusting. He has symptoms of paranoia and megalomania and the Republicans will use him to their advantage. A sad and ugly truth of our times.. You talk about Joe Biden?. I remember that scene in the Oval Office...that was also taking advantage of the mentally ill.. Yes. Trump will use whomever and whatever he can to be reelected.

"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like a typical tornado,"" said one meteorologist. In this case, the National Weather Service reported ""a very large pyrocumulus and reports of fire tornadoes.""","Australia doesn't have tornadoes, we have cyclones (hurricanes). Last year, and again this year, we had the phenomena of fire tornadoes.  So much of our country was on fire, with record heatwaves, including many places that have never had bush fires in‚Ä¶See More. Cherilyn Carroll it was terrible, I still shudder thinking about it and am anxious about this summer. Cherilyn Carroll very sad, as it  killed many poor innocent animals.. üôèüèª California fires are all too frequent; so many acres of forests & homes are lost every year. The homeowners must dread the coming of summer every year. They really need our prayers& lots of help. I also feel bad for the firefighters.üôèüèªfor them too.. Catherine Madden Pray for them. Catherine Madden Thank you.Yes we do. It‚Äôs a constant source of stress along with earthquakes.üòñ. Catherine Madden prayers? Are you kidding? Climate real political movement yes ! Your president is the worst of all on these questions, and responsible for the aggravation of all this. Prayers are irresponsible people inefficient tools. Stop electing this kind of world killer please, we all suffer through the planet because of Americans inconsequent votes.. It's intensely hot across Northern California and we had a 2 hour long episode of high winds and dry lightning last night. Really does not bode well for preventing wildfires. There are several burning nearby our area now.. Emily Szasz I‚Äôm in Petaluma, north of SF, and we got tons of rain with our lightening that lasted from about 4:30-8AM ... grateful for the rain üíó. Emily Szasz ooh too bad to hear that. Horrible, really. The moment I read about the Heatwave, my concerns immediately were for the possibility of wildfires. And this does not bode well. Our thoughts are with everybody in this part of California as well as any who are without electricity there as well.. Bless the heroic firefighters!!! May God place a protective  blanket of grace over each and every one of them.. I live less than 10 miles from this fire in North Reno It is bad bad bad.  Smoke is terrible.We had evac orders yesterday but it was changed to an advisory. Hoping they get it under control soon.  Thank you firefighters.. ZeeShelly Galliher Preziosi That would be hard,chickens go everywhere. Im glad you have a safe place to go too.I will be thinking of you all and hope the fires get stopped soon.. Carol Edmonds  They set up the Reno Livestock Event Center to hold the large animals and livestock. My friend rounded up her chickens and brought them there yesterday but when the evac order was lifted she had to go pick them up today.  So, we have som‚Ä¶See More. Shelly Galliher Preziosi Omg, that must be so scary! Stay safe!. Shelly Galliher Preziosi , be safe. Shelly Galliher Preziosi Tis the season, Stay safe!. Shelly Galliher Preziosi stay safe. Shelly Galliher Preziosi Good luck, thinking of you and everyone in this area. Praying everything will be ok quickly. So very sorry this is happening.. Shelly Galliher Preziosi be safe üôèüèΩ. We drove past Reno yesterday and saw this! An entire mountain going up in smoke. So so sad.. We have to wake up!! Mother Nature is giving us a sneak preview of her majestical powers. Remember how she dealt with the dinosaurs!!!. No one remembers what happened to the dinosaurs. Everyone who was alive then is dead. Especially the dinosaurs.. It happened since 4:00 am until 11:00 am, the sound was terrible and some places has been affected.. Mili Trujillo-Principe what happened. So sad for Northern California.  here in Southern CA we are having fires, but these Fire Tornadoes are another level of danger. They had them in the Carr fire 2 years ago. Please keep them in your thoughts!. I remember hearing about them then.  Fires bi enough and intense enough to create their own weather systems.  So incredibly frightening!. We had them during Tubbs, too. While evacuating and I could barely stand up with the wind force. Cars flpped over.  It was like the world was ending.. Big love and strong safe vibes! Northern California is my home.. These events are not going away but will get much worse if we do not make changes to the way we live and treat our Earth. We must enact tough legislation to limit our carbon footprint.. Kathleen Anguera it has nothing to do with carbon footprint. Fire Tornados.2020 just keeps getting better and better.. JP Perry ~ Y20K is Y2K on steroids. And just think, there‚Äôs an election coming up!. J Thomas Gaffney Lol except the crazy stuff actually happens. JP Perry You‚Äôve noticed.. JP Perry Not 2020 enough-- we should throw in some spiders for good measure.. JP Perry Colorado is preparing for a tarantula migration.. JP Perry I can't. I'm done.. JP Perry   This year had it all: plague, hurricanes. Floods, Earthquakes, record high temperatures, volcanic eruptions , droughts,  locusts. Regular tornadoes, fire and now fire tornadoes and melting permafrost.Did I forget anything? Oh, and the appearance of Trump, the antichrist.. Kathy Kelley Explosions, you missed explosions.. Jennifer Ashley and murder hornets. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like a typical tornado‚Äùunderstatement of the century. hmm. Because this is 2020: of course there are fire tornadoes!. John Erdahl there already were, earlier in 2020. The year certainly started as it meant to continue.. John Erdahl 2020 very difficult. The problem will be when this kind of thing happens in the next future years, becoming something usual. John we also had fire tornadoes 2018 in CA. John Erdahl , I don't understand, elite me more. John Erdahl next there will be sharks.. John Erdahl As far as I recall back in 2018 everybody was hoping for a better 2019..then 2019 was crap and everybody was hoping 2020 would be betterü§Øü•µ. HOLY crap! wait till they Sharks are added in. Kidding aside this is awful. sympathies to the victims in this tragedy.. Gary Nix    That was my first thought too.. Yes we got them as new freak phenomenons in Australia in our killer 2020 firs season. Fire trucks were picked up and tossed through the air in these events. Mad wild and far far more frightening than Covid. This is the year where the marks of Global Warming are showing undeniably. 2020 is the year it is become clear. Vote only for the survival of the planet at this point in time everyone.. Under what president has California not had a wild fire . Time to cut some timber and underbrush if you want this to stop . They know how to control wildfires.. Larry Haffner The Federal, not State, government has control of most California woodlands. FYI. Larry Haffner a good raking should do it. Larry Haffner you want us to take the forest like Trump claimed? Yeah that‚Äôll fix it.. These fire tornadoes happened in Australia in January as well, killing fire-fighters. Just horrific. üò™. Sarah D'Astoli omg. Seems we gonna enjoy MARS weather sooner then scientists predicts ü§ó cool. Voj√≠n Davids not today bloodbag. Hopefully not üòî.

The US represented a hope and an opportunity.. Can only be used in a handful of countries at present anyway unless on official travel and then your passport has a different cover..

How can the Post Office win Trump‚Äôs approval? Have they considered flattering the f**k out of him?,"Never had problems with my mail until recently. Feel bad for the people who work there. I wonder how their jobs are especially now. Can't be easy to begin with and then the leadership.. Julie Wia we‚Äôve left a note for our mail carrier on the outside of our mailbox letting them know how much we appreciate what they do üôè‚ù§Ô∏è.

Your carrier will appreciate your thinking of him. well I just found out (through FB) that the guy working at my local post office is a total trump supporter and is all in with NO voting by mailü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Of course, they could make an orange Trump Stamp for 1c. Alternatively we could all just pay a dollar each for stamps and be rid of him by mail in ballot. It will be the best  value for money ever.. Hey, and don't forget other governmental agencies require one to have a 'legal mail address'  (IRS, getting your passport) or that all of Congress  gets free (franked) mail.    We all need rely on USPS. Trevor your funny, and I like everything about your show and you, how present the facts, I'm just pissed at how we have become so broken over Dumbtrump, The United States Post Office, needs to be saved from this awful bullshit! I appricate my post man and woman, because sometimes, we get 2 people delivering mail. I need my mail! This so wrong on so many levels.. Trump said he'd fund it if he got what HE WANTS in the rest of the bill.  I think that is bribery.. Use volunteers to deliver mail in ballets to ballot boxes and as long as they're volunteering there's nothing the orange man can do about it because it's not causing him a dime or any of his time there's nothing he can do to volunteers. Guys, it can‚Äôt be safely done, so just drop it.No time to put it in place, and doesn‚Äôt do any good. It could actually complicate things up.Let‚Äôs just vote way we always are voting,...and that‚Äôs just fine.. Indeed it is, but in all probability, if Trump is running true to form, this is an attempt to distract from something worse he has in the works.. Trump is too much brother! I am tired of his bullying tactics! We need to get him out of the White House! Bullying is for losers!. Issue a USPS stamp with his face on it. üòÄ.

Are you going to tell me that you have no relatives that have ever got hooked on something.  Even though he was on drugs, he got a law degree.  Biden taught his son a work ethic.. Kellene Neering OMG no point wasting my time on you!. Lydia Vanderwalker, you should re-read my post. I'm pointing out that having an addict in the family isn't a disqualification for being POTUS.. Bone spurs? What are you talking about . Biden‚Äôs son failed a drug test twice and was removed. Oh and Biden shouldn‚Äôt be president because he can‚Äôt complete a sentence . Maybe thirty years ago but he is also a molester and creep. He has been hanging around for 50 years and has done nothing what makes you Biden supporters think he has anything new?. Rita Dalessio so true!. Dave Garland  OMG!. MaryJanice Davidson what about the guy who got fired while he and his son waited. Dan Siegfried tRump has known for over 5 weeks that putin put bounties on your friends sons and daughters and did Nothing....if you support tRump you are a traitor by proxy!. Dave Cunningham oh there‚Äôs plenty there. It‚Äôs been swept under the rug. Rita Dalessio Sure, elect the best of two evils.. I did.  I attended his book signing  He spoke of his son, family but also of his political career. There was so much about him I didn‚Äôt know  this was before he was officially a candidate. I was extremely impressed and left thinking what a man of character and political accomplishments. 50 years in office and still we don't know what he stands for. ü§î. Jean Caton in all the years in government he has done nothing. Jean Caton what accomplishments?. Sheila Cassata sounds like you are describing Trump.. Jeffrey Eskew do your homework. Jean Caton  lol. Sheila Cassata. Byron Branyon  That sounds computer generated also.. Timothy Pueyo To me it just sounds like she knows how to write well.. He‚Äôs a good man.  I am fine with supporting him. He will restore competence and integrity to our government and clearly do a better job managing the pandemic.. Never accomplished anything worth while only for himself and his family. Made them rich.Talks a good talk.. I think he‚Äôs a great man! No person serving the public for 40 years plus is free from errors and bad policy decisions (no one is perfect including myself and you - Joe/ Jane Voter) but he is the President we need for this country if we want salvage whatever humanity we have left in the US.  #BidenHarris2020. She is right. When it comes to hard-knocking political issues like the coronavirus and the economy, Joe Biden will do anything to beat Trump in November. He cares about us. He has citizenship, respect and honesty for all of us. That is why I am happy to vote for Biden and Kamala.. Compassion, intelligence, experience, morals....so ready to get back to that after this destructive mess we‚Äôve been in.. Agree... there has been no guidance, humanity, Hope or decency for three years. It‚Äôs what has made us fighting angry with each other, made us feel hopeless and lost in this pandemic, and no empathy for those who have lost lives so that our world can‚Äôt recover. We have been made a house divided by conspiracy theories, namecalling, fear and veiled threats.. How many decades on the taxpayers' dime with little accomplishment, add in the accusations by Tara Reade which fell off the radar despite reassurances that 'all women should be believed' along with rapidly declining faculties...love him, don't vote for him.

"A nursing home has pampered their oldest resident on her 107th birthday after strict coronavirus restrictions meant her relatives were barred from the celebration. Great grandmother Betty Spears was unable to mark the occasion with her treasured family and son-in-law Kevin, because of tight restrictions protecting residents at the home. St Judes Nursing Home, in Sutton, Surrey, proudly claims to be one of the only virus-free care homes in the area. Despite this, the team were determined to recognize Betty‚Äôs big day, and pay tribute to your joyous character and young spirit. Nurses pampered Betty, herself a former nurse, with beauty treatments and decorated the home in her honor before holding a special 107th birthday party full of singing and laughter.","Happy Birthday! Wish your family was with you, maybe next year and more after that!God bless you, young lady.Thank you to the staff that gave her this special day.. Seniors and elderly in homes and ALF should be allow to see thier families with precautions They are deteriorating quickly and passing away from the loneliness.. What a shame. Surely the family could've worn relevant ppe so to share even an hour with her...Hope she had a fab day though. Happy birthday Betty.x. Cruelty in the name of Covid. First of all her family is more important to her thsn a birthday party. Dhe had over 100 of them. Now too family members could be tested for the virus so you took the easy way out and forsaken her own familyWhat is it about Covid that has made prople lose their minds or are on power trips..

You guys need some priorities.. A nursing home patient being barred from seeing her relatives sounds a lot like illegal false imprisonment to me. No reason this woman can't see her relatives.. Happy Birthday to Betty Spears !! My mother was a Spears ...great name !!. Should have been able to spend it with family masked and distanced even thru a window or outside.Just my opinion.. Happy birthday!!When I end up in a nursing home my kids have strict orders to brake me out if we ever get locked down. I would rather die with my loved ones that live the few years I would have left, apart from them.. This is sickening! This BS has to stop. Wtf??? These workers have been the reason covid has killed the elderly in the past. This is about liability insurance  and money, NOT protecting grandma. People need to rise up.. This makes me so sad üòû family should be able to see them, if all I need to do to go to work is have my temp checked and a mask, the same should go with families!. Family should have been invited or outdoors so could have came 6 ft distance.. Nursing homes turned out to be death cells because of their lack of considerations towards health safety measures. Sorry but the elderly were better off in empty vegas hotels. Should take her out and move her into their own home. This isn‚Äôt right. Probably don‚Äôt want to care for her.. Happy birthday Great grandmother Betty Spears.. Happy Birthday! Hoping your day was filled with joy!. The saliva tests now being used at University of Illinois Urbana get results within 5 hrs. Imagine what a difference this would make for all nursing homes. Hope SOMEONE is paying attention.. It seems like overkill to deny her a visit on this very special birthday!!Why can't they let them wear protective covering life me nurses wear and of course a mask??!!Who knows if she'll be around until you allow visitors!!. Beautiful Betty. May you have a blessed birthday.. Wouldn‚Äôt want to be that old.  Everyone you would have known would be dead.. But I thought masks worked??

She's going to die without seeing her family. What is there to celebrate? Live and die without seeing her family? Or live and die seeing her family.....?. Man its so happy to hear good news like this.. Do the workers live in covid-free bubbles outside of work? No!!! Ms. Betty‚Äôs family should have been there..

Dolly Holden Guite exactly- We all hope there is more on this Earth that Stand for Law and Order and just want to live life! So many innocent people harmed, businesses lost, lives lostüò¢. Amazing how none of the Democrats in Washington acknowledge what is happening in their own Democrat-run cities, districts and states. Amazing how liberal mainstream media is silent and does not report what is happening. The reason is because by ignorin‚Ä¶See More. Denise Silva your so right on, let‚Äôs pray AMERICA back üôèüôè. Denise Silva. Susan Hiley, Bless your heart. üòâ. Denise Silva Amen ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è. Denise Silva I agree with you and still don't. Violence is one we can't get rid of from our current society. No government can. But i can say they only do theirs best in managing the situations. But i must say you got it right by saying vote Red!!! Vote Trump. Nora Jansen Dowling what are the legalities of governors overstepping the local.Mayors? Don't or cannot believe Republican mayors would allow the violence in their cities.. Denise Silva all in the name of power... demoRATS are disgusting. Nora Jansen Dowling Well if he its not going very well.. Denise Silva Ohio is Republican run. You may want to look that up.. Eric Chen Abraham, your Trump University diploma has expired.. Denise Silva if the Republican ran that state/city the same thing would be happening.  Get over pointing fingers. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Nelson Vaz not too bright are you. Denise Silva few months ago was all about Chicago shootings and this is another state Ohio, not gonna point fingers but I think the treatment given to the residents by these politicians aren't enough to guarantee safety.... Much needs to be done.. Mayor John Cranley is another Democrat just like Chicago, Portland, NYC, Seattle, etc. That's the problem! If you want the problem to stop VOTE DEMOCRATS OUT OF OFFICE!. Praying for people to stop embracing hate There‚Äôs a simple solution live and let live ,‚Ä¶See More. That‚Äôs how they want it, isn‚Äôt it? Not the police‚Äôs fault for your criminals, or terrorists. Bad people weren‚Äôt created by the police, so stop reflecting or making excuses. Bye Karen and Smollett.. All this is due to the Marxist BLM and nothing to do with police brutality..... They need to do something about these f****** people black lives matter terrorist group enough is enough loading Robin stealing and raping are country the Democrats are letting this happen and don't give a s*** they're destroying our country when are we going to get the help we need I need a fire them Democrats and use our paychecks to rebuild the cities and law enforcement. This is why we need to fight for our guns rights. People like this are dangerous. Freedom!. No wonder. The songs released by top rap artists from the music industry celebrates The Gangster Lifestyle. Violence, disrespecting women, hate police, drugs and crime. That‚Äôs the role model unfortunately.. Worst areas in Cincinnati. It isn't cops shooting anyone!. The Democrats are making everything worse!! They defunded the police!!! The Democrats are the party of hate and racism!!! They're putting innocent people lives in danger!!!!. Every city is major city is feeling the crime wave... it seems to be only getting worse... my city has multiple separate shootings a night now we‚Äôre much smaller than. Cinci.... Remember the panic when you couldn‚Äôt find toilet paper. Wait til you can‚Äôt find a police officer. Hate will help clean earth up in the long run.  The more people that go away from earth the better for the environment.. Wonder if those were all black on black since their lives matter so much to each other.. And not one person was shot by the police.  The police are backing down.  Be careful what you wish for !!. Social ills of having almost everyone with the gun with weak laws; the laws should be reviewed.. Wow!! We are so ‚ÄúGreat Again ‚Äú!! Doesn‚Äôt everyone want four more years of this?!!. Another uncontrollable city run by Democrats,  and they want to control the United states. COMING TO A CITY NEAR YOU.   PEOPLE get your head out of the sand, this will continue and effect every city and town,. It‚Äôs like hearing Mondays on which movie did the best in box office. But now it‚Äôs which city had the most shootings. Sad reality. Looks like social distancing and mask wearing are working out great. The sooner we can get #45 out of office, the sooner we can get back to normal!!!. Another good reason not to visit Chicago.. Wow. Cinci usually a pretty calm city Is this crap expanding If so someone needs to but a boot on the neck of this rebellion. Just a preview of more to come with the libtards supporting all of it by undermining our men/women in blue. The problem isn‚Äôt 45, it‚Äôs liberals raising children.  They are growing up now and don‚Äôt like hearing no, you can‚Äôt have this or that.  They are having tantrums because life hit square in the face and they don‚Äôt like having to earn their living.. I always said the good people  of theses citys. Should rise up with force and put the rollers on them  that kill and dedtroy..dont need them in your citys. Stand up people... Where are the community activist when you need them?. Nice job to all you Democrats in Cincinnati !. This is exactly why we need to defund the police #blm. Nothing good happens after midnight.  So much for quarantine...Or are these gangs ESSENTIAL?. Maybe if they wore a mask?. So if we look at historical records, violence, abortion, are the dnc policies intent on destroying blacks in America?. And how could a social worker handle this?! All this violence and murdering and the liberals want to cut police funding. If anything they need to increase it!. There you go.. keep voting for Democrats.. it's only going to get worse... Every neighborhood listed has a high rate of black on black crime and drug-infested. Thanks for the lack of details Fox.. This is what happens in democrat controlled cities. I tuned into WKRP in Cincinnati, less Nessman reporting that helicopters were flying over the city dropping frozen turkeys. Sounds like a big huge mess. Question is what distraction is this for? Chicago has this on a daily. This isn't LAW-ABIDING Gun Owners....these are criminals who have guns....BIG DEFFERENCE.. If it isn‚Äôt reported on WKRP I won‚Äôt believe it.. BLM is enroute to investigate.... That Defund the Police is really working ... huh left?. All you guys screaming about Democrats this and and Democrats did that need to quit crying and slap yourself. Where‚Äôs Kasich? Mr Fence Sitter.. Another democrat run city, can you say you are surprised at this?. Where is Snake Plissken when you need him?. Another beautiful night under democrat rule.. Black lives really matter, lmfao! The hypocrisy is hilarious at best.. Soooon what do any of these incidents have to do with George floyd and the moves to change policing? Or was that just thrown in there to fool the ideologues who wanted to hear about that stuff? Sounds like a poor attempt at manipulating public opinion with elementary propaganda.

More than 60 emergency calls to police went unheeded overnight in Portland as officers were preoccupied with hundreds of demonstrators downtown and were pelted by rocks.,"God bless that city‚Äôs law enforcement officers. They‚Äôve been put through the ringer now for months with no gratitude! üôè. Lori McArthur Brewer I don‚Äôt know how they take the abuse. I would have already been fired. People throwing rocks would get the right back.. Tina Davis a LOT of restraint, definitely. Thankless job. Lori McArthur Brewer. carrying out trumps race war!. Lori McArthur Brewer pretty sure beating up civilians is a clear indication they don‚Äôt have ANY restraint. This needs to stop now! We need our police. We can rid our police departments of the few bad cops. What we don‚Äôt need EVER are rioters and looters!. Patrice Davis Hoover time cull them. Shut up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1JZKZWSCu8. Patrice Davis Hoover not a few bad cops... let's start @ 50% bad 50% ok, let's start there and we can talk. These portland police officers are some of the toughest, most courageous people that I have ever seen. Theopolis comes to mind.. Like I‚Äôve said time & time again.....the city let the police down by making the federal agents leave.  If they would‚Äôve let them stay & take out the trash aka protesters, the police could do their regular job.  Unfortunately, the innocent people are being overlooked because of the incompetence of the city council!  Come on Oregonians WAKE UP!. The entire city should get together and sue the people that are letting this happen. That‚Äôs awesome and they still keep letting it happen. The stupidity of the left and liberals is through the roof and they will just keep voting them in. It will never get better until the ‚Äúright‚Äù gets involved. If they voted them they are getting what they deserve the Darwin effect is taking place.. If they ever loved that city, they need to re-elect the guy to start knocking some heads!  Right now his hands are tied.  At this point, I‚Äôm sure they find issue with the brand of toothpaste he uses!!!!  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Is this even a surprise? The residents of Portland deserve better than this. Those who voted in (and continue to support) the derelict mayor/officials of the city should realize you can‚Äôt have it both ways. You want to defund the police? Yet still call them the moment you realize you‚Äôve got no one else? Sickening. Way to go! Elected Officials are a Disgrace. Vote Red or this will be in every single city in the US. God Bless and Protect those who serve.üá∫üá∏. I live 2 hours south of Portland. Our govenor is useless and doesn't care. However, the rest of us have to make sure we have our masks on or face a $1,000 fine. Oregon is one of the worst places to live in the country. High taxes, high unemployment, terrible school system, housing costs are ridiculous, etc. etc. etc.. Hopefully Oregon will be waking up from this, and realize that voting blue has been destroying them. They will turn into a red state.. And yet the marxist leaders of this failed city claim that Federal officers were the problem. And what happened when they left? These rioters barricade a police building with people inside and tried to burn them alive. This isn't protesting, its viol‚Ä¶See More. This is why we MUST have gun rightsüëä Defensive measures are necessary, when the government you pay to protect you messes up their one job.... LMAO. People of Portland get what they tolerate. Feel free to recall your mayor and the rest of the city council. The ones in control aren't doing chit for law abiding citizens.. Hmmm....  Looks like Oregon has a real handle on serving the people who contact 911.  Nice going, Oregon.  I hope your residents remember you at the ballot box...  Karma..... They voted their local government in and now they need to pay the price.  Let‚Äôs see what happens in the next one.  No sympathies here.. The taxpayers in Portland deserve better if they really do need to quit voting Democrat. One of my friends used to call Oregon, God's Country. Well the devil has wrecked that.. Pride the citizens of this city will wise up and vote Republican. Can't have it both ways. Sorry for those that didn't want any of this. Get out and vote in Nov.. Portland has done this to itself. Decisions are not without consequences.. My heart goes out to the people of Portland put at risk by these protestors.  I hope that vote the crap out of that city.. Keep voting blue and your whole life will be unheeded ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Giving them no support, take away their defense and cut the budget what exactly did you expect to happen !. It must suck to live there , and I live in Chicago , so I feel and understand the pain of all this none sense ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. If any 911 call that couldn't be handled ends up with severe consequences, any one charged with rioting during that time should be charged with some degree of hindering aid.. Aren‚Äôt we defunding the police? What‚Äôs the problem? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Actions have consequences...voting for democrats for example.. all police should take a month of and leave the rioters to it.city council should respond with their social workers. Sadly, it's what Portlanders get for voting in libtards. And, keeping them. They can change it.. If I were the police union I‚Äôd be organizing a nationwide strike. Enough is enough.. That‚Äôs what they get for defunding the police. They deserve it because they voted for whoever in charge.. ‚ÄúGood luck with that‚Äù- Oregon State Police. It is an ongoing futile situation, because of inept liberal democrats taking their cues from the Washington D.C. inept liberal democrats.. Law abiding citizens need to ban together and run their mayor, DA and everyone else in charge out of town.. Did they send out unarmed social workers instead? üòÇ. Sorry Portland but you elected officials who won't stand up to rioters and anarchists. I don't feel bad for you at all. You voted for socialists and this is what you got. Have you learned anything yet?. Time for some water cannons!!!. Where is the Community Services Resource Strike Force Team?. That‚Äôs your future Portland unless you get your act together.. defund the police, so why should they respond???. Stand with Trump and take our country back!!!!. The beautiful PNW city Portland destroyed by the left. Very sad.. Hopefully the people of Oregon will wake up.. Portland, one of the first cities to fall.. Cops should stage a walk out and sit back and watch the city burn. Then pull all federal money out of the state and tell‚Äôem good luck.. Go Bill Barr!!! They messed up for disrespecting you the way they did in that hearing. Pain coming.. Have the people of Portland learned their lesson for electing democrats?. Wonder how those people of the 60 emergency calls to 911 now feel about defunding the police  and their citiy leaders.. This is a shameful disgrace. The Army, not the national guard needs to take control of that city and treat hostile combatants like they normally do. And then the useless fringe weirdo local left politicians can debate over who gets to bury all the dead so they can continue to feel involved.. I believe both Portland and Seattle are trying to recall their mayors.","['fringe', 'whoever', 'enforcement', 'cues']","['contact', 'ongoing', 'residents', 'normally', 'enforcement', 'liberal',

the ringer now for months with no gratitude lori mcarthur brewer i do not know how they take the abuse i would have already been fired people throwing rocks would get the right back tina davis a lot of restraint definitely thankless job lori mcarthur brewer carrying out trumps race war lori mcarthur brewer pretty sure beating up civilians is a clear indication they do not have any restraint this needs to stop now we need our police we can rid our police departments of the few bad cops what we do not need ever are rioters and looters patrice davis hoover time cull them shut up patrice davis hoover not a few bad cops let us start 50 bad 50 ok let us start there and we can talk these portland police officers are some of the toughest most courageous people that i have ever seen theopolis comes to mind like i have said time time again the city let the police down by making the federal agents leave if they would have let them stay take out the trash aka protesters the police could do their regular job unfortunately the innocent people are being overlooked because of the incompetence of the city council come on oregonians wake up the entire city should get together and sue the people that are letting this happen that is awesome and they still keep letting it happen the stupidity of the left and liberals is through the roof and they will just keep voting them in it will never get better until the right gets involved if they voted them they are getting what they deserve the darwin effect is taking place if they ever loved that city they need to re elect the guy to start knocking some heads right now his hands are tied at this point i am sure they find issue with the brand of toothpaste he uses is this even a surprise the residents of portland deserve better than this those who voted in and continue to support the derelict mayor officials of the city should realize you cannot have it both ways you want to defund the police yet still call them the moment you realize you have got no one else sickening way to go elected officials are a disgrace vote red or this will be in every single city in the us god bless and protect those who serve i live 2 hours south of portland our govenor is useless and does not care however the rest of us have to make sure we have our masks on or face a 1 000 fine oregon is one of the worst places to live in the country high taxes high unemployment terrible school system housing costs are ridiculous etc etc etc hopefully oregon will be waking up from this and realize that voting blue has been destroying them they will turn into a red state and yet the marxist leaders of this failed city claim that federal officers were the problem and what happened when they left these rioters barricade a police building with people inside and tried to burn them alive this is not protesting its this is why we must have gun rights defensive measures are necessary when the government you pay to protect you messes up their one job lmao people of portland get what they tolerate feel free to recall your mayor and the rest of the city council the ones in control are not doing chit for law abiding citizens hmmm looks like oregon has a real handle on serving the people who contact 911 nice going oregon i hope your residents remember you at the ballot box karma they voted their local government in and now they need to pay the price let us see what happens in the next one no sympathies here the taxpayers in portland deserve better if they really do need to quit voting democrat one of my friends used to call oregon gods country well the devil has wrecked that pride the citizens of this city will wise up and vote republican cannot have it both ways sorry for those that did not want any of this get out and vote in nov portland has done this to itself decisions are not without consequences my heart goes out to the people of portland put at risk by these protestors i hope that vote the crap out of that city keep voting blue and your whole life will be unheeded giving them no support take away their defense and cut the budget what exactly did you expect to happen it must suck to live there and i live in chicago so i feel and understand the pain of all this none sense if any 911 call that could not be handled ends up with severe consequences any one charged with rioting during that time should be charged with some degree of hindering aid are not we defunding the police what is the problem actions have consequences voting for democrats for example all police should take a month of and leave the rioters to it city council should respond with their social workers sadly it is what portlanders get for voting in libtards and keeping them they can change it if i were the police union i would be organizing a nationwide strike enough is enough that is what they get for defunding the police they deserve it because they voted for whoever in charge good luck with that oregon state police it is an ongoing futile situation because of inept liberal democrats taking their cues from the washington d c inept liberal democrats law abiding citizens need to ban together and run their mayor da and everyone else in charge out of town did they send out unarmed social workers instead sorry portland but you elected officials who will not stand up to rioters and anarchists i do not feel bad for you at all you voted for socialists and this is what you got have you learned anything yet time for some water cannons where is the community services resource strike force team that is your future portland unless you get your act together defund the police so why should they respond stand with trump and take our country back the beautiful pnw city portland destroyed by the left very sad hopefully the people of oregon will wake up portland one of the first cities to fall cops should stage a walk out and sit back and watch the city burn then pull all federal money out of the state and tellem good luck go bill barr they messed up for disrespecting you the way they did in that hearing pain coming have the people of portland learned their lesson for electing democrats wonder how those

Joseph Brown i dont think its the citys duty to keep every business safe. Thats why stores pony up for security guards. Alessandro Valignano by this logic all of Colorado is Antifa along with other states that provide it for medical use. Most people that use pot are so laid back they have trouble getting off the couch, much less going out to riot. Blaming pot for everything may make you feel better, but it's not reality. Do some research, enlighten your sheltered mind.. Joseph Brown REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER TRUST TRUMP , NOT AGAIN. ‚Ä¶See More. Amanda Williams It is the city's responsibility to pay for the damage when they don't support the police and officers that would've stopped this. Since the mayor told police to stand down, who should've stopped this?. Right.  We have to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù towards our fellow man by wearing a mask and distancing, at the SAME time people are attacking others and their businesses.. Kathleen Ziska Terlizzi its a must for us to do so.But here in Africa we dont take this virus serious. Sue the city big time! That is the only way things will change--if it hits the city money wise.  Go for it, get a huge settlement.. Yes please! Sue the city big time for allowing this to happen! (Breach of duty by these so-called leaders) These people are trying to work and survive... Stealing is stealing! No excuse!. The city will probably charge the shop owner for having glass on the sidewalk. That's what they did in minneapolis..charged a business burned to the ground $3k for a fence the city out up around the rubble. So much lawlessness, we need to stop defunding law enforcement!. This was not stopped by the mayor or govenor. Time for everyone to take a stand in all that they have worked so hard for. However it will take a long time since nothing was done in the beginning when it should have.. Good. I hope they all sue. It's a breach of duty by these so-called leaders and they need to be held accountable!. More business owners and people who have had their property destroyed or threatened should sue the city and the state,.. ALL the business owners should sue that mayor! And it should happen in every city that has had looting & destruction.. Good , they allowed this to happen . You have a right as an American citizen to be protected. Absolutely correct to sue the city.  The mayor is shameful.. 2nd Amendment should take care of that real quick if people would learn how to defend themselves!. Hope you sue for lots , you deserve every penny because Chicago fired  police that are supposed to be there to protect their citizens. Be STRONG and BEST OF LUCK !üëçüôèüëç. This is the America of the Democrats and that‚Äôs exactly why our Great President Trump Will Indeed Win Big Time. Good Day and God bless.. As he should. The Mayor should also be held criminally liable. Ordering the police to stand down should make you an accessory to the crime.. I don't  know what officials are planning but whatever ...it is NOT working to protect their citizens and their ability to own and run their business. I don't  think they have mental capacity to govern.. Sue them... they failed to do their jobs as elected officials.  Unfortunately, these officials are immune to lawsuits.. the process takes time and before you know it... they are out of office or there's another distraction.... FORCE THEM ALL OUT OF OFFICE.. All the stores need to leave and let the mayor deal with it seeing she is not helping stop this. As well he should.  The Mayor has done absolutely nothing to stop anarchy.. Sue the mayor who allowed the anarchists and looters to stay. Sounds like they need to infuse the police with funds instead of defunding...it's a shame. Time to take your businesses out of Chicago.. Because it‚Äôs those darn convenience stores that cause so much ‚Äúoppression‚Äù. Chicago mayor and DA should be held personally responsible.. They can thank Lightfoot who has allowed this to happen.. stop voting for Democrats, yes it's really that simple. A class action suit seems in order. There is strength in numbers. The only problem is collecting from a bankrupt city and state.. Exactly why we cannot have Democrats in office. Turn the whole country RED in 2020!!!!. He should just sit in the store with a gun and protect himself with the second amendment. Shoot one and the rest will run out. Hope he wins and then takes that money and moves his business somewhere where he can count on elected officials to actually defend his business and the law abiding citizens.. .... All the stores should sue the city and if they can't get money, get tax breaks or Zero property tax ...... Good Lord! What is happening to Democrats run cities? Portland, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Minneapolis. Why people why?. Should sue Chicago  , the BLM marxist and Antifa organizations  and the democratic party. ....all are guilty  !. I wish every business owner would move out and let these thugs kill each other and wipe Chicago off the map. I have zero sympathy. Mayor Beetlejuice maybe can justify?????. I think we need to send all the liberals to just one sanctuary town and let them just tear the hell out of it and let them live in those kind of conditions.. Chicago has had nothing but record high murders and garbage to report for the last ??? Years...why? Do good people even live there? If so why?. Arm yourself AND sue the governor, mayor and city. Crazy!!  WHO  raised  the  people  doing  this?  Never  in  my  wildest  worst  times  would  I ever  do  something like  this...NEVER!. Think hard before you vote!  You‚Äôre seeing just how important your choices are.. Avoid Chicago at all costs... I cannot fathom how anyone could possibly believe destroying the livelihoods of your fellow neighbors is productive in anyway.... How does destroying businesses that provide services to your area help in anyway? They are hurting their own communities by limiting supplies to everyone also. Imagine if that were your own business and people did that to you? Where are these peoples humanity?. Good for the shop owner, all businesses and private citizens  who have had their business and private properties vandalized and/or looted should be bringing class action suits against the mayors and governors who are allowing this to happen!  There are still laws against this ENFORCE THEM!. Macy's is moving out of downtown. Hopefully all the other businesses follow suit in Chicago. I couldn't imagine owning a business down there right now.. So Sad! Firearms are the answer as you drop each and every person coming in to loot your home or business!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏. I'd sue the city, the idiotic mayor and the worthless governor!!. I‚Äôm tired of the excuse the rioters give by saying ‚Äúthey have insurance they can rebuild‚Äù when they destroy a business. What about those who work there? Those who needs that job to pay their bills? You trash their business and burn it to the ground, those people are out of work. Hoping these businesses learn a lesson to not set up shop in these Democrat run cities that are letting everything burn. According to Nadler this is just the same clip being shown over and over again.  The rest of the democratics especially in DC say this is peaceful protest.  Democratics should be held accountable.  Those that allow this to happen for political gain.. These cities should be sued... you pay taxes for public safety and when they at best enable and encourage this chaos they should be held accountable. ‚ÄúThey have insurance.‚Äù  At least that‚Äôs what

property tax good lord what is happening to democrats run cities portland new york seattle chicago minneapolis why people why should sue chicago the blm marxist and antifa organizations and the democratic party all are guilty i wish every business owner would move out and let these thugs kill each other and wipe chicago off the map i have zero sympathy mayor beetlejuice maybe can justify i think we need to send all the liberals to just one sanctuary town and let them just tear the hell out of it and let them live in those kind of conditions chicago has had nothing but record high murders and garbage to report for the last years why do good people even live there if so why arm yourself and sue the governor mayor and city crazy who raised the people doing this never in my wildest worst times would i ever do something like this never think hard before you vote you are seeing just how important your choices are avoid chicago at all costs i cannot fathom how anyone could possibly believe destroying the livelihoods of your fellow neighbors is productive in anyway how does destroying businesses that provide services to your area help in anyway they are hurting their own communities by limiting supplies to everyone also imagine if that were your own business and people did that to you where are these peoples humanity good for the shop owner all businesses and private citizens who have had their business and private properties vandalized and or looted should be bringing class action suits against the mayors and governors who are allowing this to happen there are still laws against this enforce them macys is moving out of downtown hopefully all the other businesses follow suit in chicago i could not imagine owning a business down there right now so sad firearms are the answer as you drop each and every person coming in to loot your home or business i would sue the city the idiotic mayor and the worthless governor i am tired of the excuse the rioters give by saying they have insurance they can rebuild when they destroy a business what about those who work there those who needs that job to pay their bills you trash their business and burn it to the ground those people are out of work hoping these businesses learn a lesson to not set up shop in these democrat run cities that are letting everything burn according to nadler this is just the same clip being shown over and over again the rest of the democratics especially in dc say this is peaceful protest democratics should be held accountable those that allow this to happen for political gain these cities should be sued you pay taxes for public safety and when they at best enable and encourage this chaos they should be held accountable they have insurance at least that is what that idiotic

Enjoy a moment of Zen with Japanese macaques (or snow monkeys) as they soak in natural hot springs.,"Love these monkeys, ther are beautifull creatures ‚ù§Ô∏è. Not all of them have an invitation of this pool party!They have a strict hierarchy and they chase away those who are at the bottom of the hierarchy.‚Ä¶See More. Beautiful, animals really are sensitive. The fact people hurt them is so sad & cruel. LOL You don't know that they have a strict hierarchy and they chase away those who are at the bottom of the hierarchy.So not all of them have an invitation of this pool party!. Was it you guys or Nova that did an ep about the one with the deformed hands and feet(?)that was struggling to raise her baby? It was a long time ago. It was very moving and interesting.. Love their soulful little eyes, like they‚Äôre contemplating life & know something we don‚Äôt... üíúüíïüíú. I love Nature and all living things!. Ella I can't bring myself to finish the resolution question in the i.c lecture and have found myself watching this video on repeat so plz enjoy. so cuteeee. Meditation must be helping them manage the low temperatures. Hello dear friend mademoiselle or madam, I am new to the network and I would like to make friends again through I like to discover new horizons and I would like you to make from my new friends I tried to send you a friend request but she refuses voila why I want you to send me an invitations you be very nice good evening to you ?. Saw them on a Nat Geo trip - Amazing!!!. They certainly do look peaceful and wise. However, isn't this the species that has an elite class. Only the elites use the hot tub, and they force the others to sit outside in the cold weather, shivering with their babies.  This reality of nature does not bother me, but it runs counter to most of these comments.. Pat Bosler exactly üò¢. I always wonder how do they dry themselves. So Ling Yan not only do they bathe and meditate, they can also weave towels.. Niklos Moorman and invent blowdryer I hope. Its fur could dry out like a towel. So Ling Yan with towels. So Ling Yan saunas are the most popular way to go in Japan. So Ling Yan japanese hairdryers. I think I know how they feel. Ever take a bath in a leanto shed? Snow outside? Almost freezing inside and then the hot water (heated on a wood stove)?. I've experienced hot springs in Iceland in the middle of winter. Fantastic. I feel sorry for the lower caste monkeys of the troupe that are not allowed in the hot springs whilst the elite are in. Nature in action unfortunately.. Oh I too saw this snow monkeys at Hokkaido flower dome park.they extremely active.no sure whether is e same species.. They poop in the hot spring all the time. They keep a full time employee at the park just to clean up all the poop üí©üí©üí©üòÇ.. Even monkeys know to relax better than some humans... This is in Nagano, Japan!. What happens when they get out wet fur in the cold icicles?. Does anyone know how do snow monkeys to keep themselves dry and warm after they leave the hot spring?. Seuls les macaques bien nantis peuvent profiter de ces eaux chaudes... les moins nantis sont sur le c√¥t√© √† se les geler ü•∂. Love these guys...they know how to live....aaahhhh.

Gail Dragon really explain please. Get real,,, tRunp is diagnosed psychopath. Dave Fuller voteing absentee you request a ballot from the voteing authorty. they send you 1 you fill it out and send it back carefully following the instructions.  Mail in is the voteing authority mails out ballots to every address, or registered voter, like pizza coupons.. Irene Hamburger  six states already have mail in voting. And they have been able to count millions of ballots on election day. https://www.npr.org/.../why-is-voting-by-mail-suddenly.... See my subject below.... If I have to. If that POS thinks he will keep me from voting, he is sadly mistaken..

A catheter or diaper if necessary.. I‚Äôve already requested an absentee ballot.  If it comes in time I will drop it at the elections bureau.  If it does not come I will vote in person.. Not really a fair question. Willing to stand in line and able to stand in line are two very different things. My sympathies lie with the people who are physically unable to stand in line.. I would walk over broken glass barefoot, through a cloud of covid 19 aerosol without a mask to VOTE the Terrible Trump out of the people's Whitehouse. !!!!.

The Trump Administration has finalized plans to sell oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Sarcasm is usually next and then denigration. Just move on. You have nothing to contribute but spewing nonsense like a child in a school yard.. Bob Ureey yes, your personal experience is vetted. I completely believe everything you say. So informative and such leadership.. Bob Ureey sure, basing important decisions and how they are administered should be based on your twisted worldview and anecdote. Because someone disagrees with you they're childish. You unprepossessing balatron.. Bob Ureey oil is a finite resource, don‚Äôt get me wrong here, I race motorcycles, own a diesel van etc but eventually fossil fuels will run out. Maybe it‚Äôs better to be investing in some alternative technologies such as hydrogen etc now so that we are prepared globally for the demise of fossil fuels! Just a thought..

And if you did you‚Äôd have a hard time finding it. Substantially damaging a pristine refuge is repugnant in and of itself, but doing so when our energy situation makes it unnecessary is truly depraved. Remember this and other assaults on our environment on November 3rd.. Peter Schaffer we should use other nations oil first.. Russell Haughey its called renewable resources.  This government refuses to see that it actually works.  Eventually we will have dug all over, ruined land, and still run out of oil..

Say it with us: END THE SCHOOL-TO-PRISON PIPELINE,"We need to end police on campus! Bring back  school counselors. I was shocked when I was looking at middle schools for our daughter and found that there was an officer in uniform on campus at all times! For 5th thru 8th grade! Stop it! Our schools are so too heavy with administration, it's time to define what is necessary there!. i remember going to public school and they had to start bringing in police because of violent liberals. Church of Political Correctness You should be institutionalized.. Desiree Hrebtov one of these days we will find someone who will standup for our views.  Sure, they will probably get humiliated in a debate too,  BUT at least we will be standing up for ourselves!!! That will probably make the KKK mad!. Starting in the 1980's the US stopped hospitalizing the mentally ill and started incarcerating them, why is anyone surprised that they are doing it to physically disabled folks too?  Incarceration is the American answer to poverty, unemployment, and disability, it's what we do best, and with great enthusiasm.. Michael Garrison sadly, you are right.  Reagan closed the public hospitals and the mentally ill were on the streets.  Now many people want to get ‚Äúthose kids‚Äù away from their kids.  I work in special education.  I hear it and it makes me nauseous‚Äîfrom administrators to outspoken parents.. The most common consequence for children sent to jail is their failing that grade, because they have too large of a gap in their learning to catch up. Probably the 2nd most common consequence is their acquiring new friends (criminal friends.) The least likely consequence is rehabilitation. For some reason the government finds this unimportant.... Defund the racist public school system. Students with disabilities are the butt of all jokes. The other kids blame them for everything because they know the teacher will believe them and reprimand the student with a disability. I know this from experience.. This is why I Moved back to Canada. When we were in several school systems in the US, I could see them starting to treat my son like a criminal.  I wasn't having it, and now he's doing brilliantly. ...can not end that; it's a proven money-making niche.... As a teacher of emotionally Impaired students this is pretty much my kids exactly.  They are most likely to wind up in the system.  They get identified early, they generally have teachers who cannot or will not learn how to handle them and spend more t‚Ä¶See More. When I was in grade school in the '80's kids weren't arrested - disabled or not! I never heard about that. Have parents really become THIS inept as not be able to teach their own kids how be behave in school/society? Are you kidding me!!. A catholic school principal tried to set my son up.  Tried to accuse him of violence against an aide.  The aide told the truth; she had not followed his IEP, which directly led to a small, non-violent outburst.  This was part of a pattern of accusation‚Ä¶See More. So special needs kids who get put in normal schools aren‚Äôt having their special needs taken care of.

it is a combination of factors you have the myth of southern manhood which was shattered by the reality of how southern armies performed particularly after defeats when conscripted southerners frequently deserted as soon as they had the to remove civil war monuments because of slavery would be like removing world war ii monuments because of the holocaust many are designed not to commemorate or exalt slavery or genocide but to commemorate victory over them daniel haulman that line of thought makes no sense daniel haulman the soviets blew up any nazi imagery they found when they took berlin but go on theo collins not all civil war statues are confederate i am speaking about the other ones daniel haulman so you are changing the subject we do not have statues of hitler stalin musselini or hirohito here we do not fly the flag of any other country that made war against us so why does the confederacy get special treatment swing and a miss not civil war monuments but those put up to commemorate a group that rose up to destroy the country as a whole so they could continue keeping people as slaves the confederacy were traitors not patriots they have enough representation in history they do not need statues to them mainly to run their racism into those who are not like them white daniel haulman that reasoning is so idiotic i am surprised you even are allowed internet access maybe daniel is simply trying to make the argument that he supports these statues of slavers and traitors because he is stupid not racist i moved to georgia two years ago form kansas city and am astounded by the number of people displaying a flag as a veteran i consider to be not only a symbol of hate but a symbol of people that were at one point in time considered traitors i had

"Posted @withregram ‚Ä¢ @nlg_seattle  Learn more about NLG legal observers in Seattle! #NLG #NLG_SEA #SeattleProtest #SeattleProtests #Seattle  ‚Äî  WHAT ARE LEGAL OBSERVERS?  WHO ARE LOs?  Legal Observers are lawyers, law students, and legal workers trained to observe and record law enforcement actions towards protesters.  Legal observers monitor police behavior, not protesters.  Legal observers are identifiable by neon green hats that say ‚ÄúNational Lawyers Guild‚Äù and black vests with neon labels.  ON THE GROUND Legal observers watch and document police interactions with protesters to deter violent police tactics and for later legal advocacy in criminal and civil cases.  When protesters are arrested, we get necessary info to connect arrestees with legal and community support.  We make sure that the right to protest is protected and support protesters when they are targeted by the state.  LEGAL PROTECTIONS When a group request legal observers, we establish an attorney-client relationship with the organizers so that our work stays confidential.

government policies change during this movement because the results may be worse than the current situation hmpf hard to imagine results worse than what we have endured as a result of 400 years of white supremacy on this continent breathe you will adjust federal jail for them jim holden who is stream i cannot recall i watch them nightly there are a lot of videos online that show him trying to help the trans woman here is a screenshot from before he got back in truck that is when they targeted him it was pretty sad this does not show the full clip he tried to leave not run over anyone this is murder period kathy chavanell right antifa and their ilk is just violentthe rioters and criminals assaulting the innocent driver are liarswelcome to what liberals are doing to the guy took the license plates off his truck before driving to the protest site and was driving erratically around the area where the demonstrators were at i highly doubt he was there for any other reason than to try to hurt people nathan birkeb k that is not true there are videos of incident before the crash he and his wife parked to attempt to help a trans woman who had been harassed robbed by the mob they targeted him because of this and tried to pull him out of his nathan birkeb k what danger was he after being taken from his vehicle if you are trying to run a mob over am i supposed to believe you could somehow miss them all keep spinning lies another peaceful protest i hope nobody is surprised by this can we please do something about the violence and destruction in the streets now micki hussung the easiest thing to do is first stop voting republican 2 temper your reaction when you hear things designed to inspire anger against minorities task police with protecting the protesters instead of beating them support people exercising their 1a rights isaac herington well its not tempering my reaction i do not have a hateful heart and i know so many who do not either so when we know there are some people who hold onto racist beliefs what kind of solution can we get to that does not destroy innocent people i genuinely like these types of conversation because it is impossible to come to 1 solution that works for everyone so the better way of life for the cowardly protesters is to beat a man to death and then demand the police protect them while they destroy the city andrew harris our 1st amendment does not support people destroying property or raping and beating random civilians also defund the police and fund public safety so the cops will stop gassing people beating them and destroying property like slashing tires and bashing car windows open bullsh t i have seen the video he had been attempting to protect a trans woman that the protesters were in the process of beating and robbing and then when he attempted to escape the seen the protesters surrounded his vehicle caused him to crash pulled him from his vehicle and beat him unconscious f ck the protesters why are they still allowed to do this i am hearing where the driver has just passed away can anyone else confirm this crashed his truck wtf he died jeannine arbuckle i cant find where he died jeannine arbuckle he deleted what he said so you did not see it but he said good that why he is apologizing brent koenig sorry i did not mean it i misread what happened brent koenig oh sorry so sad we need to stop killing it is not the answer heard he passed away blm and antifa killed him angry stack bodies reload repeat michael samuelson these are domestic terrorists and should be treated as such they are

up sand got kicked in the face he gave up scott dechy you are bob garlough once he is out of the car no need to defend yourself there is no justification for this david harris they parked truck and were helping a trans woman on the sidewalk who had been harassed robbed by the mob it is on video david your blind what seems to be lost on many people here is the incredible imbalance of power between a pedestrian and a motorist what seems like no big deal to a motorist is a life and death situation to a pedestrian of course i am not trying to justify vigilante justice but i am saying that we all have a right to defend our lives terrorists this is straight terrorism another reginald denny nina russell based on what i read about the reginald dennys case it looked like a hate crime to me i do not know whether his case is similar to the one being reported in portland igor soloydenko you think being kicked in the head and beat to death by a group is not cause enough to be deemed as a hate crime peaceful nazis i mean protesters another tough antifa jackazz tough guy when he and his cronies have one person outnumbered then a cheap shot kick to the head probably thinks he is mma

"Facing a public backlash over mail delays, the Trump administration scrambled to respond Monday as the House prepared an emergency vote to halt delivery interruptions and service changes that Democrats warned could imperil the November election.","The statute that created the Postal Service begins with the following sentence. ‚ÄúThe United States Postal Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States, authorized by the Constitution, created by an Act of Congress, and supported by the people.‚Äù 39 U.S.C. ¬ß101(a).. William H Bockemuehl the USPS is just fine. It's run like a business because it doesn't take tax payer money.. Now the blind sheep republicans want to tank the post office because the conman told them that mail in ballots, of which there were 25 million cast in 2016, are bad. Good luck to rural America on getting anything delivered without a functioning USPS.. Donn Colby https://www.facebook.com/officialbenshapiro/videos/383196325997422/. Susan Robinson Fu@k him, and fu@k you for spreading his üí©.. Thank you!  We‚Äôve been all mail voting for more than 5 years in WA and think ü§î it‚Äôs great.. Elizabeth Moorhead is that why many Culp ballots were so late getting counted or not at all. Just curious.  I know our mail from here in the Tri Cities, have gotten lost or not delivered.  True story.. Lou Smith sounds like that would be an issue with your county elections office since all ballots are counted locally in each county. If you have tracked your ballot online to see if it has been recieved then it will show when it is counted.. Elizabeth Moorhead ...don't you remember all the Eyman cucks calling the car tab election rigged since it was ALL MAIL IN... me either lol.... Elizabeth Moorhead and it took years to get it going so smoothly. Can‚Äôt be done in less than 3 months.. Elizabeth Moorhead. It's so great in fact, that we are still waiting for our primary votes to be counted. How wonderful. I can't wait to find out in July of 2021 who won the presidential election. Really super awesome.. Dont like Nancy... she needs to go... but I'm glad this is happening.. Josh Neff yeah she is too effective and men are threatened by her but sure.... Josh Neff  trump should go first before Nancy.. They all have to go. Political parties and lobbies have no legitimate place in sitting government, as they do nothing but corrupt. Either the parties can't stop it or won't stop it. Doesn't make any difference. As long as they're there, they are going to run the country, and they have no business doing that. It's in direct violation of the Constitution.. Jill Stohs My issue isn't her ability to be 'effective'... its how she's effective that I take issue with. She's very much in the back-pocket of corporate america. You can look through her voting record and find comparatively little which has benefit people vs businesses.. David Tran absolutely.. Josh Neff that goes for everyone of them since Reagan signed Citizens United. Before that there where specific laws about how much a special interest could give. Also Congress members where barred from owning stocks or any interest in a corporate entity. Any business interests had to be reported and given to US Treasury who would then issue them municipal bonds of value. Maybe she could work on renewing CaresAct funding too.. Tristan Smith ‚Äî no. There was money in the House bill for all states, because of lack of federal leadership all states were on their own to mitigate pandemic costs.. Morgan Alexander Did that 3 months ago. Still on McConnell's desk... Morgan Alexander agreed but Trump needs to keep his nose out of USPS. Trump‚Äôs unraveling we are just starting to see the very beginning.. Kathleen Batinovich Nemec dems wanted you bail out failed democrat ran states!. Kathleen Batinovich Nemec true. In the Tri-Cities, population of approximately 300,000, we have no post office other a place to buy stamps and check your PO Box. It's been this way since before Trump and during the Obama administration. It takes 5 days for a letter to be mailed to an address across the street but you all want to blame Trump. How ignorant.. Monday the House prepared an emergency vote....next week!. The USPS is just fine. USPS doesn't need the 25 billion tax dollars.  Mail boxes and equipment are moved regularly.  The skanky hag Pelosi is tampering with the election. She's second in line for presidential succession. When the election ballots get jammed up for weeks in January that sleaze will grab the presidency.. Why do they need testimonies? All they can do is come up with a budget, send it to the Senate, send it to Trump and he will sign it!  The DemonicRATs can come up with trillions of dollars to give to China, Russia and Iran, go figure, but they need testimonials it it comes to what‚Äôs happening within our country!. Dolores B. Pinaula Knowledge is power.. Do you ever question why this is so important to the Democrats? Could it be so they can cheat? I‚Äôm willing to bet. Defund USPS instead of the Police. üëçü§£. ... Demon-crats fear disruption of their manipulation of elections .... Scott Mc. Scott Mc - name-calling, demonizing of ‚Äúthe other‚Äù without any evidence = shoddy election time shenanigans from tRUMP and supporters.. Scott Mc I don't mean to be rude but please put the crack pipe down and read very carefully. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS NOT MANIPULATING ANY ELECTIONS. LOOK AT MR. TRUMP. Scott Mc Republicans are going to lose they are out of touch in November they‚Äôll be out of time. Scott Mc. Scott Mc agreed. Scott Mc Oh come on-you know that‚Äôs not true!. Scott Mc do you have any evidence for your claims? The last/only major voter fraud case was promulgated by the GOP in North Carolina. Evidence of voter fraud is basically nonexistent but why let facts get in your way?. Scott Mc drink up. Scott Mc. Scott Mc Meanwhile in reality, President trump has already all but admitted he is going to manipulate the election.... Scott Mc I want my medications on time! It has little to do with politics in the long run.. Scott Mc TROLL!. Scott Mc enjoy your Clorox cocktail. Scott Mc No crackpots, please.. The stupidity and trolling in the comments never fails to disappoint. Chris Smith yes Chris they never fail do they ??. Nancy is evil and is not to be trusted! She lied!. After over 45 years, SUDDENLY they care. Tim Cook EXACTLY. !!    SPOT ON!!. Right, just like the last one. How did 45 win???. Lol ‚Äúdemoncrats‚Äù whenever I see this I automatically assume whoever wrote it is also a flat earther and involved in QAnon.. Joy Weiss trolls from a troll factory prob in russia or africa. But she won't come back to negotiate covid relief. Seems like she hates the American people.. Matt Rutledge put down the pipe its the gop senate that never made a deal. Sadly Moscow Mitch wont do the same for the Senate. They want to talk about mail in ballots instead of helping the people ü§¶_‚ôÇÔ∏è. Robert Reyes the House has already passed the Covid bill, Moscow Mitch has refused to let it be voted on and the Senate hasnt sent a bill of their own to the House yet.Its completely in the Senates court right now. Robert Reyes being able to vote by mail IS helping people...unless you somehow think access to voting isn't a right?. Mail helps people.... Its because they know the cowardly Republicans won't do anything to help they have made that blatantly clear. Robert Reyes it IS helping the people! Anything to get Trump and his cronies out of office!!. Julie Crudele üòÇüòÇüòÇ. While you are there how about working on the stimulus package.. Not true.

Deb West Nope, it's a distinction without a real difference. Voter fraud isn't a real problem, people. Well, there were the Republican in NC caught collecting and filling out ballots. You know, most cases (the few prosecuted) are by Republicans. Huh. https://www.factcheck.org/.../trumps-absentee-vs-mail-in.../. Tell that to the people of New York who had their ballots tossed out... New Jersey... shall I continue?Mail is safe? Google MAIL THEFT.... Lynda Little I think ‚Äúschooling‚Äù would be wasted on you but that‚Äôs ok. Trump loves the uneducated.. Deb West Sometimes I just have to shake my head and walk away. You can‚Äôt fix stupid and it just causes my blood pressure to rise trying to do it.. Pam Braun well I had to for primary in 2016 it was on the outside of the envelope you had to identify your party. Dusty Belair I voted this year during the primary and there were no identifiable markings on the outside of the envelope denoting party affiliation. There was also a slip on the inside for privacy so you can‚Äôt see through the envelope.. Pam Braun you are making a fool of yourself.. Tom Stewart true. They are out on a hard earned va-cay, Nancy.. Why is it so difficult for people to understand the difference between absentee ballot and mass mailing? You can explain til you are blue in the face as I have, and people still can‚Äôt comprehend the difference.. Lynda Little ‚Äî there is no such thing as ‚Äúmass mailing‚Äù. Ballots are sent to registered voters not dropped out of a plane for anyone to pick up.. Lynda Little Both are processed exactly the same..How can it be so difficult to understand?. This is not the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes, ballots are sent to registered voters, not blindly to addresses.. How about the people - greedy old woman - so fake.. Problem is all 3 have to agree. Coming back now for this BS IS JUST A WASTE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS!. They ‚Äúscrambled‚Äù did they? LoL! ü§£ü§£ü§£. This is their vacation time, yes, a week to gather the House is a scramble.. Since the mail-in's envelopes will be designated with a D or an R, depending on your affiliation, it should be rather easy to toss the D's in the shredder.  üòá. Alfred Colley Source please. I've lived in a vote by mail state for over 20 years. Your statement is too stupid to bother to refute. Troll block.. Don‚Äôt you have an Applebee‚Äôs to check in at.

And you might ask for a new K-12 education while you‚Äôre at it. They all look the same.. Crickets.  üòâ. Alfred Colley primary ballots? In the primary elections people have to vote for the party they are registered with. That‚Äôs not the case in the general election.. Post office!#@?! What about the Stimulus package!!!. Where was crying Nancy for the last 20 yrs while the postal service lost billions of dollars and tries to cover her failures during special budgets. Why was this done during normal budget time.

u s c 101 a william h bockemuehl the usps is just fine it is run like a business because it does not take tax payer money now the blind sheep republicans want to tank the post office because the conman told them that mail in ballots of which there were 25 million cast in 2016 are bad good luck to rural america on getting anything delivered without a functioning usps donn colby susan robinson fu k him and fu k you for spreading his thank you we have been all mail voting for more than 5 years in wa and think it is great elizabeth moorhead is that why many culp ballots were so late getting counted or not at all just curious i know our mail from here in the tri cities have gotten lost or not delivered true story lou smith sounds like that would be an issue with your county elections office since all ballots are counted locally in each county if you have tracked your ballot online to see if it has been recieved then it will show when it is counted elizabeth moorhead do not you remember all the eyman cucks calling the car tab election rigged since it was all mail in me either lol elizabeth moorhead and it took years to get it going so smoothly cannot be done in less than 3 months elizabeth moorhead it is so great in fact that we are still waiting for our primary votes to be counted how wonderful i cannot wait to find out in july of 2021 who won the presidential election really super awesome dont like nancy she needs to go but i am glad this is happening josh neff yeah she is too effective and men are threatened by her but sure josh neff trump should go first before nancy they all have to go political parties and lobbies have no legitimate place in sitting government as they do nothing but corrupt either the parties cannot stop it or will not stop it does not make any difference as long as they are there they are going to run the country and they have no business doing that it is in direct violation of the constitution jill stohs my issue is not her ability to be effective its how she is effective that i take issue with she is very much in the back pocket of corporate america you can look through her voting record and find comparatively little which has benefit people vs businesses david tran absolutely josh neff that goes for everyone of them since reagan signed citizens united before that there where specific laws about how much a special interest could give also congress members where barred from owning stocks or any interest in a corporate entity any business interests had to be reported and given to us treasury who would then issue them municipal bonds of value maybe she could work on renewing caresact funding too tristan smith no there was money in the house bill for all states because of lack of federal leadership all states were on their own to mitigate pandemic costs morgan alexander did that 3 months ago still on mcconnells desk morgan alexander agreed but trump needs to keep his nose out of usps trumps unraveling we are just starting to see the very beginning kathleen batinovich nemec dems wanted you bail out failed democrat ran states kathleen batinovich nemec true in the tri cities population of approximately 300 000 we have no post office other a place to buy stamps and check your po box it is been this way since before trump and during the obama administration it takes 5 days for a letter to be mailed to an address across the street but you all want to blame trump how ignorant monday the house prepared an emergency vote next week the usps is just fine usps does not need the 25 billion tax dollars mail boxes and equipment are moved regularly the skanky hag pelosi is tampering with the election she is second in line for presidential succession when the election ballots get jammed up for weeks in january that sleaze will grab the presidency why do they need testimonies all they can do is come up with a budget send it to the senate send it to trump and he will sign it the demonicrats can come up with trillions of dollars to give to china russia and iran go figure but they need testimonials it it comes to what is happening within our country dolores b pinaula knowledge is power do you ever question why this is so important to the democrats could it be so they can cheat i am willing to bet defund usps instead of the police demon crats fear disruption of their manipulation of elections scott mc scott mc name calling demonizing of the other without any evidence shoddy election time shenanigans from trump and supporters scott mc i do not mean to be rude but please put the crack pipe down and read very carefully the democratic party is not manipulating any elections look at mr trump scott mc republicans are going to lose they are out of touch in november they will be out of time scott mc scott mc agreed scott mc oh come on you know that is not true scott mc do you have any evidence for your claims the last only major voter fraud case was promulgated by the gop in north carolina evidence of voter fraud is basically nonexistent but why let facts get in your way scott mc drink up scott mc scott mc meanwhile in reality president trump has already all but admitted he is going to manipulate the election scott mc i want my medications on time it has little to do with politics in the long run scott mc troll scott mc enjoy your clorox cocktail scott mc no crackpots please the stupidity and trolling in the comments never fails to disappoint chris smith yes chris they never fail do they nancy is evil and is not to be trusted she lied after over 45 years suddenly they care tim cook exactly spot on right just like the last one how did 45 win lol demoncrats whenever i see this i automatically assume whoever wrote it is also a flat earther and involved in qanon joy weiss trolls from a troll factory prob in russia or africa but she will not come back to negotiate covid relief seems like she hates the american people matt rutledge put down the pipe its the gop senate that never made a deal sadly moscow mitch wont do the same for the senate they want to talk about mail in ballots instead of helping the people _ robert reyes the house has already passed the covid bill moscow mitch has refused to let it be voted on and the senate hasnt sent a bill of their own to the house yet its completely in the senates court right now robert reyes being able to vote by mail is helping people unless you somehow think access to voting is not a right mail helps people its because they know the cowardly republicans will not do anything to help they have made that blatantly clear robert reyes it is helping the people anything to get trump and his cronies out of office julie crudele while you are there how about working on the stimulus package not true voting by mail is one of the safest ways to vote especially during a global pandemic show me a reliable study that says otherwise you can use google to find several academic articles that say it is safe and does not favor either party in pam braun actually i do read them but apparently you do not or if you do you do not comprehend them know what i am done talking with you you obviously suffer from extreme tds and it affects your ability to see things logically continue to live in your own little bubble it just may burst bye deb west nope it is a distinction without a real difference voter fraud is not a real problem people well there were the republican in nc caught collecting and filling out ballots you know most cases the few prosecuted are by republicans huh tell that to the people of new york who had their ballots tossed out new jersey shall i continue mail is safe google mail theft lynda little i think schooling would be wasted on you but that is ok trump loves the uneducated deb west sometimes i just have to shake my head and walk away you cannot fix stupid and it just causes my blood pressure to rise trying to do it pam braun well i had to for primary in 2016 it was on the outside of the envelope you had to identify your party dusty belair i voted this year during the primary and there were no identifiable markings on the outside of the envelope denoting party affiliation there was also a slip on the inside for privacy so you cannot see through the envelope pam braun you are making a fool of yourself tom stewart true they are out on a hard earned va cay nancy why is it so difficult for people to understand the difference between absentee ballot and mass mailing you can explain til you are blue in the face as i have and people still cannot comprehend the difference lynda little there is no such thing as mass mailing ballots are sent to registered voters not dropped out of a plane for anyone to pick up lynda little both are processed exactly the same how can it be so difficult to understand this is not the publishers clearing house sweepstakes ballots are sent to registered voters not blindly to addresses how about the people greedy old woman so fake problem is all 3 have to agree coming back now for this bs is just a waste of taxpayer funds they scrambled did they lol this is their vacation time yes a week to gather the house is a scramble since the mail ins envelopes will be designated with a d or an r depending on your affiliation it should be rather easy to toss the ds in the shredder alfred colley source please i have lived in a vote by mail state for over 20 years your statement is too stupid to bother to refute troll block do not you have an applebees to check in at alfred colley all envelopes look the same did you graduate from trump university really i am serious if so you need to ask for a refund and you might ask for a new k 12 education while you are at it they all look the same crickets alfred colley primary ballots in the primary elections people have to vote for the party they are registered with that is not the case in the general election post office what about the stimulus package where was crying nancy for the last 20 yrs while the postal service lost billions of dollars and tries to cover her failures during special budgets why was this done during normal budget time it is a scam pam morrell um you are the one telling veterans at usps that they do not matter and as a liberal what do you think my position on pentagon spending has been for the last 40 years pam morrell they do need money because congress passed a law requiring them to pre fund pensions for decades into the future you need to read that article tom bourg hahahaha pam morrell they made a profit in 2014 julie crudele pam morrell nothing was done during normal budget time because trump waited till it was over to start pulling the mailboxes and shutting down the post office if this was really necessary why was not it done two years ago the reason why it is pam morrell have you left your home to go to the dr the grocery store gas station walmart cvs was that a yes you can vote in person what delivery interruptions are those right after her third bottle why there is no crisis at the post office according to the head of the american federation of government employees afge this is just another democratic faux crisis perpetuated by their media lackeys philip and he calls for the heroes act to be passed to prevent problems in his summation and calls out trumps intent to sabotage he is stating explicitly that what pelosi is doing is necessary and proper derek pounds yes did you the national association of letter carriers nalc and the american postal workers union apwu know the truth the members of these unions are the people who actually process and deliver the mail postal workers and derek pounds democrats cry about everything so glad to vote for trump have you left your home to go to the dr the grocery store gas station walmart cvs was that a yes you can vote in person at least one party is working for the american people tracy thomas it is not the republicans donald klempke correct what a bunch of nonsense as usual hate to tell the radical left wing pelosi this but the senate is not in session lolol covid 19 good news continuesjerry is not saying that he agrees with this 100 but it is information from a really smart person so take it for what it is worth and do not let fear rule your life and news you see on tv is meant to scare you that is she needs more botox may be it will get her brain working she is the reason they should have a law against stupid people breeding or voting even runing for office joe smolik insults are decidedly unhelpful got any real ideas or values since all you can manage are personal insults i can only assume you have no problems with her politics there joe she needs to go to jail catch that she called them back to vote on the mass mailing of ballots which only 5 states have the capabilities of and she did not call them back to vote for you the american citizen small business or nothin her priorities are not with you just like they are not with the people in her district which is the works place to live work in the country these days tim anderson the house has already passed the covid bill moscow mitch has refused to let it be voted on and the senate hasnt sent a bill of their own to the house yet its completely in the senates court right now tim anderson hey dingleberry the house already passed a relief bill tim anderson like you would know works place they house passed their covid bill 3 months ago the republicans turned it down before they even looked at it you are right tim and here s an article in which our secretary of state kim wyman who many states go to for advice regarding mail in voting has to say about the feasibility of country wide mail in voting by november mail has been slow for years now

"The August primary is over, but can you name the current state superintendent of public instruction, the commissioner of public lands, or the insurance commissioner? If the answer is no, you're not alone. Maybe it's time to shrink the number of statewide elected officials and put the responsibility of some offices under the control of the governor. Ultimately, this would increase public accountability, writes Jason Mercier of the Washington Policy Center in an Op-Ed.","These positions should remain elected positions so those elected are accountable to the public.  Making them appointed positions would increase the likelihood elected officials would appoint their cronies.  We have enough of that in DC now.. I think more people this year can name the State Superintendent and none of us want Inslee appointing someone to that position.  Maia Espinoza for State Superintendent 2020.  I think giving the governor any more control would be more of a disaster.  No thank you.  People should be informed and should vote.. Tami Stander Kee and they don't. Most of us rely on other groups to inform voting. It's not really an individual thing. I mean. I can find out any of these people in like 5 seconds.The question is if it's useful for us to vote on this. Or if they should just be appointed positions. The Washington Policy Center is a right-wing pro-corporate think tank that's butthurt about, for example, an elected Insurance Commissioner that keeps Washingtonian's best interest at heart.. I think many of us have very different political views but what we all seem to agree on is that this is a terrible idea.. No. Wait till we elect some tyrant such as we have to a certain other high office I can think of. Will we want all the responsibly for every aspect of governance concentrated in a single office? ü§î. Deirdre Gabbay I agree, we do not want Inslee doing this. Bob Rogers we do not want any one person to have too much power.. The election of Donald Trump and his subsequent administration demonstrates why we need elected officials not under the thumb of a Governor (state) or President (country)..

Invasive English Ivy that has been cut by one of our hardworking #ParkStewards, John Bremer! John has personally put in more than 430 volunteers hours in the past six months to restore this section of the park. This has included removing several tons of damaging English Ivy and Himalayan Blackberry. These invasive species destroy habitat for wildlife, reduce biodiversit...y, damage trees, attract rats, and smother native plants. Huge thanks to John for all of his incredible work!!

,"Fit is everything. My former advisor was a great scholar, a good person, and a hard worker...but just wasn't a great 'fit' for me in terms of temperament and what kind of mentorship works best for me. My current advisor ticks a lot of the same boxes, but his temperament is far more complementary to mine, and it has made a huge difference.. Shaun Russell former advisor wasn't a fit for you or you weren't a fit for him üòÉ. Shaun Russell  - I‚Äôm just trying to understand; how can someone not be a good fit for a good person? The worst thing is when you end up with some supervisor who‚Äôs a bad person and doesn‚Äôt care about people.. Milan Toma For me, it's about advising style and expectations...when to put a lot of pressure on the advisee, for instance, and when to be more friendly and encouraging. The 'iron sharpens iron' approach doesn't work well with me personally. Lol, so basically an incoming grad student needs to have such a sharp innate sense of human psychology so they can ‚Äúsmell‚Äù the advisors with good vs bad personalities during the short amount of time at visit days. That, or be able to discern which of the upperclassmen stories are most plausible.. Cara G. Chapel I see, that totally makes sense. In my case, I didn't have direct help like that from any professors during my undergrad, it was more about looking up professors online, chatting with grad students from different programs etc. Either way‚Ä¶See More. Lindsay Rachel ^ Yup, exactly this. I was truly concerned that if I switched advisors, there would be repercussions of some sort, but it turned out that after I passed comps, my advisor himself told me something along the lines of. Jenna Lynn Cody this is why liberal arts colleges are better.  I maintain contact and advising with my students for years after they graduate.. BaftƒÉ Irina!. Shaun Russell if only that was true for my program. Seems to depend on the reputation/prestige of the mentor your leaving whether it is possible. Instead I had no choice but to leave my program entirely once working with my mentor was no longer an option for me.. Haha, yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a survival of the fittest, but so are most things in life. Lol, I didn‚Äôt take myself too seriously when I commented, and I was not expecting so many responses. Very interesting perspectives!. Also, you can always do your research. Specially contacting former students can be very helpful.. Irina Cristali Seconding what Shaun said. I came in and selected my advisor based on like research interests. He's an amazing scholar and was a fantastic advisor, but he wasn't into the signature research methodology of my program. It led me down the p‚Ä¶See More. You can tell a great deal by taking a course with them. (I couldn't but then, that's me.). Irina Cristali already gave you suggestions about what to look for. I rocked some boats changing mine. But I'm in Korea and they have an intense mega hierarchy filled culture. Still did it though and I'm still alive :). Interview potential PIs as intensely as they're interviewing potential grad students. You're 'auditioning' them as much as they're evaluating you. Don't just hope to get accepted to any program. Because when things go badly it's awful for everyone involved. It's extremely important to select a program based on an advisor that will work well with you.. Mike Fabris I assumed you meant that the undergraduate mentor would know and could advise on the postgrad faculty because they were colleagues at the same institution; my bad.

Irina Cristali yeah! can't we all just consult our crystal balls? as a tenure track librarian (so, that = a nonacademic to all other tenure track folks, apparently), mentors I've met have taken joy in careers they've never helped foster, or even taken ‚Ä¶See More. Irina Cristali more like ask the right questions and don't be afraid to ask around. Irina Cristali 'Survival of the fittest' I wish it was as simplistic as that. Spend a few years at UChicago and you will realize.. Irina Cristali I think it is more about identifying your most productive work conditions and how you work best with a manager/advisor and then having an honest conversation with potential advisors before you make a decision.. I chose my MS advisor poorly and it was the worst decision of my life. My MS was an absolute nightmare. I had to fire my entire committee and form a new one to graduate. Fortunately my advisor for my PhD was awesome. Otherwise there's no way I'd have been able to stick through it to the end.. Well said. I chose poorly for my PhD, finding someone who matched my research interest and purportedly had expertise to offer, but had no vested interest in mentoring. Seeing as I developed my own funding, was working full time, and a new father, the a‚Ä¶See More. Melissa Pardi I am not denying it, just asking how...? As a grad student, I have very commonly worked in the lab 9am-7pm, weekends included. And considering that day has 24 hours, plus one has to sleep, I dont see the math here. I guess it depends on the field, but in chemistry, grad school is a full time (and more) job. If you cannot invest your time into it, it is quite impossible to succeed.. Most of my friends in anthropology had jobs, because they didn't have departmental support. They also tended to take on average 8-10 years to complete a PhD.. Romi It really is based on discipline--some of us can/need to balance FT jobs and studies. If anything, that's even more important when choosing a mentor because I would hate to have one who felt I wasn't dedicated enough bc I need to work. My FT emplo‚Ä¶See More. My full time job was at the university conducting research, and I developed additional funding to address my PhD interests. And, I was pretty adamant about living a balanced life without being taken advantage of by unreasonable demands. That didn‚Äôt sit‚Ä¶See More. Romi Jaro≈°ov√° the ‚Äúhow‚Äù may vary by discipline. My dad did his PhD while working FT in administration at a 2 yr technical college and 5 of us 7 children still lived at home (youngest was already 9 or so though, no infants). His university was also a 45 minute drive away. His discipline was English though, so lab work wasn‚Äôt part of it.  I‚Äôm not sure he slept and he did take 7.5 yrs to finish but he made it work.. It very much seems that a handful of mentors swap mentees into faculty openings and that it does not matter at all how brilliant or ground breaking the research is of the poor saps who didn‚Äôt work with these gate keepers.. Wes Grooms spot on. Wes Grooms yup. I know what you are talking about. If one individual relationship can make or break a career, perhaps it is time to put all our brilliant, critical minds to work on alternatives to the current structures.. Yes,  one  person  shouldn‚Äôt  have  that  much  power  over  someone  else‚Äôs career.  It‚Äôs all  well  and  good to  tell  new  researchers  to  choose  their  mentors wisely,  but  how  are  they  to  know  which  ones  turn  out  to  be  psychopaths?. I made some bad choices from the get-go. Some were my fault; others were not. I ended up having to ask my MA thesis advisor (from a different university) to co-chair my dissertation committee. If it were not for him, I would have quit. Drove 350 miles to nurse me through comps, which were very much like swimming though a pool of broken glass. I picked my mentors because I admired their work. Luckily for me, they are also two wonderful human beings. I wouldn't have made it through my program without their support.. It sometimes can be really tough to tell, especially when the advisors are very manipulative and are able to convince their current students that the toxic environment they created is normal. If you end up with an advisor that doesn‚Äôt workout, your car‚Ä¶See More. Absolutely the truth. My mentor coached me through my MA, then hired me as full-time faculty only a year after I finished my PhD. She is the reason I went into academia and I can never thank her enough.. My dissertation committee has been out to lunch the entire time‚Äîexcept for the head. He gets done what needs done‚Äîbut offers no encouragement. He just clicks the boxes. I‚Äôm months away from finishing and I will absolutely never teach at a public university. It‚Äôs turned me away.. I've chosen my university through my supervisors. While for me it was the logical thing to do and I was lucky those folks wanted to work with me, you never know whether relationships may change down the road. They can get better but they can also get worse.. My mentor is now in his 80s. I spend a week with him and his wife every summer. He has dementia, it is rapidly progressing, and I have a textbook that was just published that I dedicated to him. I am trying so hard to get him a copy while he can still recognize how I'm honoring him ‚òπÔ∏è. It's breaking my heart, he is SO important to me, still. ‚ù§Ô∏è A good mentor changes your life.. They can also make or break your mental health. You're extremely reliant on this person and spending a good deal of time with them. You want to make sure you're a good match research-wise, but also personality. Having an advisor that I communicated well with and was supportive was the only reason I finished my PhD.. Alexis Layman Mraz This is so true! The amount of pressure is already too high and when the matches are not good, it can lead to burnout.. So much this! I left grad school (ABD) in part due to poor mentorship. I went on to a career evaluating graduate and postdoc programs, and strong mentorship was always one of the most important factors in making a program and it's participants successful. Not enough is said about this to starry-eyed undergrads looking for the right name..  I had some trouble with this during my Master‚Äôs. I learned that valuable lesson before the PhD. I am incredibly fortunate to have had an amazing PhD chair and two amazing committee members.. Yep, I chose mine based off of research AND personality (totally ignored university prestige and location). Best decision I ever made - she was and still is unwaveringly supportive, not only of my research but of my physical and mental health.The way‚Ä¶See More. How many students can become suicidal and make attempts because of a supervisor....? So far our count is 4 and it‚Äôs continuing after changing supervisor. Absolutely choose your supervisor carefully.. In practicality, it‚Äôs better to have a poorer mentor and more well-received institution. From what I‚Äôve seen, this holds true in academia and industry contexts alike.. Definitely. Advice for prospective grad students: don't just interview your potential supervisor before making a decision: if possible, reach out to their former students as well.. I have a friend who's been through hell, is on the verge of quitting altogether, after many years, because of her mentor. I also think that it's almost impossible to tell. I think university needs to be rethought and recycled.. I had no idea who I wanted to mentor me during my doctorate. Got very lucky and met my supervisor at a lecture in the first week. I had no idea if he was even interested in my research topic but I knew I had to ask... five years later I wrote something I am so proud of that I actually hope it gets published eventually. The right mentors make or break.. When you come from a poor background, you get chosen by the scholarship team. You have zero say in either the university or the mentor.. The words are the truth - if you fail to pick mentor that is good for you - this doctoral experience can and will be a nightmare for  you.  Look at your mentor's vitae - see if they work with students and if they do - who is the lead author on student'‚Ä¶See More. Kris Machtmes exactly.. This is one of the most important post for aspiring PhD candidates. I chose my advisor and uni because I was told she was the best in my field and the university had prestige. Turns out she didn't chose me for my project or my intellect. Rather the fee‚Ä¶See More. Also, there was only one person at the university I could have changed  to as advisor. Guess who he was married to.... Also, don‚Äôt forget that students pick advisors. Mentors pick themselves, with a little encouragement from the student.. So true - It broke me for many, many years . Still no closure or accountability for egos or downright lies to cover backs.. I chose mine based off research interests and my experience with them through undergrad. WOW was that a stunningly bad move. How staff treat non-threatening undergrads and how they treat postgrad students who can question them can be very different.. The whole advisory team is important in terms of having a mix of expertise that the student can tap into, and varying approaches to supervision/training/support. I was very lucky during my honours and PhD, and got different things from my different supervisors. It's something I try to replicate now when putting together supervisory teams for my students.. One tool for figuring this out is to use social media and their website to see what credit they give to their research students. Are the authors diverse? Do the students get lead credit? Are the students presenting their research or is the faculty doing it all? Social media has really changed the game.. Absolutely agree with this - all the prestige in the world won't mean squat if you don't finish and get a good piece of work out of it, and that won't happen if you and your supervisor don't gel. I turned down a place to study my PhD at Cambridge to wo‚Ä¶See More. And do lab  rotations if you can!. Don't confuse a supervisor with a mentor in the first place. They're different things.. My grad advisor used me to do his work and hindered my work. He was absolutely lacking in every way.. This was the best and biggest tip my Honors Thesis supervisor gave me in undergrad and I will always and forever be thankful to him for it!. Congratulations for finding a fit mentor; I couldn't find any, fit or otherwise.I'll be thankful if I get a relevant postdoc mentor right now.. I changed my university from Cornell to Univ. of New Mexico to work with the right advisor. I never regretted that decision until he passed away 2 months before my defence.. Tijen Tunali Oh wow! That sounds horrible! Amazing that you still graduated though! And cool that you are in Europe too! I‚Äôd actually be interested to talk to you about our experiences and now being in Europe and all that - would you mind if I sent you a message?. Jana Wilbricht The story gets more tragic while waiting for an advisor to replace my prof.and she was the biggest manipulator I have met in my life. It took me 3 years to graduate with a finished dissertation. I am back to Europe too :). I chose a great school with vastly less prestige than a top 3 choice I had in my field precisely because I had great options for a mentor!. How do you see if your potential advisor is a good fit or not if you have never met/worked with them?. ‰ºçÊò≠Êòé exactly what I have heard from my colleagues. I agree that talking to the students is important for some kind of second/third opinions. But perhaps some students are not comfortable to speak frankly about their PI especially if the students will still be working for them for a long time.. You should meet with them at least once.  I mean you're going to be working closely with them for years.  Talking with their current and former students is also a good way to determine their mentor style.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to their current students without the PI present. Ask them straight what it's like to work with the PI and what their expectations are.. Fadil Habibi Danufane you will be able to tell whether they actively like the professor or just reluctant to criticize him/her due to other concerns. Fadil Habibi Danufane I met with several prospective advisors remotely, never in person.. ‰ºçÊò≠Êòé definitely. I think you can't be shy to work with another mentor if it becomes evident that the fit isn't right.  A bad fit might not be evident at first.. I asked a lot of questions, including their mentoring philosophy, expectations, how they approach various scenarios, how they like to give feedback, how often they like to meet, how writing papers with them works, how decisions are made, stuff like that. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to them ahead of time, talk to their students, read between the lines in what the students say. Look at their past students‚Äîwhere are they now? If it‚Äôs a newer PI, reach out to past undergrad mentees. A new pi should be willing to give references to them.. You can read about them and see if they are a bad fit for everyone or not.. Fadil Habibi Danufane talk to former and current students. it's so hard to know what to even ask if you've never experienced it.... but one good one is 'how is work life balance ?'. Talking to current/former students is tricky. 10 people, 10opinions. I loved my advisor when I was ar grad school, while there where people who really didnt like him and decided to leave.. Fadil Habibi Danufane Rolling the dice on whether or not a positive interaction is indicative of a positive future relationship with someone directly in your field of interest is definitely superior to just YOLOing a school for name recognition and hoping for the best. That was a long sentence.At least try to Zoom or phone interview with people beforehand. It is worth it.. Big red flag: they don't graduate many students in a reasonable amount of time. This is easy to find out.. In academia (at least in the US), the status of the university defines everything. The rest is b.....t. I'd love to be able to find the funding to go with my supervisor of choice but sadly that not currently happening üò≠üò≠üò§. The same applies when picking graduate students.. Choose carefully for  the short term and the long term  both.. Hard to do when one is assigned!. I learnt that the hard way.. Pat Owen does this count as a citation?. Definitely read it at first to be referring to our study! Might have to count it just to be on the safe side ;). Travel time and tell me this...  maybe I‚Äôd still be doing science and not drywall. And that isn‚Äôt a joke...  if you find yourself in a masters degree with an advisor who hates you...  GTFO, industry if you can..  unless you want to do a ‚Äúunderpaid‚Äù internship...  and if you think science is awesome and that could never happen...  got some news for you. Zarmeen Khan  yup yup yup.. Abso-frickin-lutely.  I chose two of my my three thesis advisors based on personality rather than politics, and when I defended, the woman I chose to lead the committee intervened at personal cost and saved my graduation date from the vindictive harrid‚Ä¶See More. Cara G. Chapel Yes. I had a great Ph.D. Advisor but I had asked a professor that I thought would be supportive to be on the committee. After he said yes, I heard from other students and faculty about how he did what you described. Fortunately, for me, he took a job elsewhere about 6 months before I defended. I have never been so glad to see a moving truck leave.. I'm not in academia but health care and you speak the truth. When I was attempting to get admission to a PhD program, I was given absolutely horrible advice from my half brother, an asshole, which helped sink me. I did not know better. Few people really know going in what they need to know and do. Mentors are *so* important.

advisor was not a fit for you or you were not a fit for him shaun russell i am just trying to understand how can someone not be a good fit for a good person the worst thing is when you end up with some supervisor who is a bad person and does not care about people milan toma for me it is about advising style and expectations when to put a lot of pressure on the advisee for instance and when to be more friendly and encouraging the iron sharpens iron approach does not work well with me personally lol so basically an incoming grad student needs to have such a sharp innate sense of human psychology so they can smell the advisors with good vs bad personalities during the short amount of time at visit days that or be able to discern which of the upperclassmen stories are most plausible cara g chapel i see that totally makes sense in my case i did not have direct help like that from any professors during my undergrad it was more about looking up professors online chatting with grad

was very lucky during my honours and phd and got different things from my different supervisors it is something i try to replicate now when putting together supervisory teams for my students one tool for figuring this out is to use social media and their website to see what credit they give to their research students are the authors diverse do the students get lead credit are the students presenting their research or is the faculty doing it all social media has really changed the game absolutely agree with this all the prestige in the world will not mean squat if you do not finish and get a good piece of work out of it and that will not happen if you and your supervisor do not gel i turned down a place to study my phd at cambridge to and do lab rotations if you can do not confuse a supervisor with a mentor in the first place they are different things my grad advisor used me to do his work and hindered my work he was absolutely lacking in every way this was the best and biggest tip my honors thesis supervisor gave me in undergrad and i will always and forever be thankful to him for it congratulations for finding a fit mentor i could not find any fit or otherwise i will be thankful if i get a relevant postdoc mentor right now i changed my university from cornell to univ of new mexico to work with the right advisor i never regretted that decision until he passed away 2 months before my defence tijen tunali oh wow that sounds horrible amazing that you still graduated though and cool that you are in europe too i would actually be interested to talk to you about our experiences and now being in europe and all that would you mind if i sent you a message jana wilbricht the story gets more tragic while waiting for an advisor to replace my prof and she was the biggest manipulator i have met in my life it took me 3 years to graduate with a finished dissertation i am back to europe too i chose a great school with vastly less prestige than a top 3 choice i had in my field precisely because i had great options for a mentor how do you see if your potential advisor is a good fit or not if you have never met worked with them exactly what i have heard from my colleagues i agree that talking to the students is important for some kind of second third opinions but perhaps some students are not comfortable to speak frankly about their pi especially if the students will still be working for them for a long time you should meet with them at least once i mean you are going to be working closely with them for years talking with their current and former students is also a good way to determine their mentor style fadil habibi danufane talk to their current students without the pi present ask them straight what it is like to work with the pi and what their expectations are fadil habibi danufane you will be able to tell whether they actively like the professor or just reluctant to criticize him her due to other concerns fadil habibi danufane i met with several prospective advisors remotely never in person definitely i think you cannot be shy to work with another mentor if it becomes evident that the fit is not right a bad fit might not be evident at first i asked a lot of questions including their mentoring philosophy expectations how they approach various scenarios how they like to give feedback how often they like to meet how writing papers with them works how decisions are made stuff like that fadil habibi danufane talk to them ahead of time talk to their students read between the lines in what the students say look at their past students where are they now if it is a newer pi reach out to past undergrad mentees a new pi should be willing to give references to them you can read about them and see if they are a bad fit for everyone or not fadil habibi danufane talk to former and current students it is so hard to know what to even ask if you have never experienced it but one good one is how is work life balance talking to current former students is tricky 10 people 10opinions i loved my advisor when i was ar grad school while there where people who really didnt like him and decided to leave fadil habibi danufane rolling the dice on whether or not a positive interaction is indicative of a positive future relationship with someone directly in your field of interest is definitely superior to just yoloing a school for name recognition and hoping for the best that was a long sentence at least try to zoom or phone interview with people beforehand it is worth it big red flag they do not graduate many students in a reasonable amount of time this is easy to find out in academia at least in the us the status of the university defines everything the rest is b t i would love to be able to find the funding to go with my supervisor of choice but sadly that not currently happening the same applies when picking graduate students choose carefully for the short term and the long term both hard to do when one is assigned i learnt that the hard way pat owen does this count as a citation definitely read it at first to be referring to our study might have to count it just to be on the safe side travel time and tell me this maybe i would still be doing science and not drywall and that is not a joke if you find yourself in a masters degree with an advisor who hates you gtfo industry if you can unless you want to do a underpaid internship and if you think science is awesome and that could never happen got some news for you zarmeen khan yup yup yup abso frickin lutely i chose two of my my three thesis advisors based on personality rather than politics and when i defended the woman i chose to lead the committee intervened at personal cost and saved my graduation date from the vindictive cara g chapel yes i had a great ph d advisor but i had asked a professor that i thought would be supportive to be on the committee after he said yes i heard from other students and faculty about how he did what you described fortunately for me he took a job elsewhere about 6 months before i defended i have never been so glad to see a moving truck leave i am not in academia but health care and you speak the truth when i was attempting to get admission to a phd program i was given absolutely horrible advice from my half brother an asshole which helped sink me i did not know better few people really know going in what they need to know and do mentors are so important lifting each other up is crucial ,"{'advisor': {'score': 153.13077434178814}, 'students': {'score': 132.1538414989126},

‚Ä™How to make your Zoom look more professorial,"I`m giving a conference-presentation on Zoom next week and I was thinking that it`s going to look weird with my tidy room. It`s great that someone has taken the time on their busy schedule to make such a thorough instructional video I can utilize to overcome this problem.. Use cats. As long as you have a couple of cute furballs in the back, you could have a skinned, decapitated corpse right next to you and no one would complain. Trust me, I've tried it before. Works like a charm.. I have three cats, I know what you mean üòª. I'm desperately trying to hide that I'm set up in the corner of a room that was never really unpacked. I signed for the house the same week I did my first capstone defense, and setting up the spare bedroom was never a priority. Yesterday, work gave m‚Ä¶See More. It‚Äôs missing some random tangled electronic cords that serve no function because the thing no longer works, also: where are the random carrier bags stashed in the corner?? Otherwise nailed it!!. After my defence, when my committee handed me their copies back so I could make my ‚Äúminor changes‚Äù, I literally found someone‚Äôs name and phone number written on top of a page on one person‚Äôs copy. I could not for the life of me figure out if I was supposed to call that person or not.. I think you should call Human Resources... after you're done, of course, just to play it safe.... Andr√© Guerreiro lol, just to clarify, this was more than a decade ago.. This is amazing. Please call the number.. I'm under the impression that many commentors here have not watched the actual video (it's humour wink wink). Tom As Veines yeah that‚Äôs pretty clear.. That's a relief. I'm gonna need to see a couple of dead, dusty plants in the corner.  Otherwise the he look isn't fully professional. üòÑ. Christina Rivers Now we're talking, thanks!. I was completely called out by this video.. Krista Smith my thoughts exactly. I‚Äôm clearing out the dead plants Monday. Effortless but not quite sprezzatura. Sprezzatura is an Italian word that first appears in Baldassare Castiglione's 1528 The Book of the Courtier, where it is defined by the author as 'a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever'. Kimberley Sarah I suspect you're too well organized to feel seen by this video or to feel the need to raid other languages for words to justify a certain nonchalance and lack of planning.. Haha so much effort into appearing nonchalant üòÖ. No printer paper - printer broke months ago :( There are bookshelves in mine, but not neat at all... And I do, mid-class, break out and say 'oh,  I have a book on that!' and spend 5 minutes shuffling through it.... Which may mean they see my highly proffessional fuzzy slippers, complete with bear claws. üòÅüëèüëè Oh, he totally nailed it. The only two things missing were a leather satchel and conference lanyards tacked to a bulletin board.. LIterally LOL'd at the photos. My office pictures feature my 2 and 4 year olds being precious, taken about a year after I started the job. They're now 13 and 15. Notably missing are 2 other children and a grandchild.I finally framed and hung my diplo‚Ä¶See More. I recently framed & hung mine,  in year 18. Regalia also usually on the back of the door though for some reason I can‚Äôt remember now, I brought it home from the last event. Where it will stay for the foreseeable future.... ‚ÄúIs that a picture of your dog? So cute!‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, yeah... well my old dog... who died... 6 years ago...‚Äù ‚Äú*awkward silence*‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I guess I should put some new pictures up in my office.‚Äù üò¨. Based on assumption that one has an office, lol. Anna Krstevski yeah...#adjunct. No cat making an appearance = a lack of attention to detail. Also a random artefact that says you‚Äôre down with the kids, like a Beatles record or a Star Wars poster... and a guitar!. Jokes aside, if you want to look more 'professorial' care about your students, especially now.. ....I'm feeling very attacked right now. Mary Wilkerson me, too!. Who do I call about him breaking into my office to do research?  Dear God, the box his last electronic purchase came in!. How many of y'all who so clearly didn't watch the video also complain about students who don't read your syllabus?. People in the comments are like students who didn‚Äôt do the reading talking about the book cover üòÇ. I feel equally seen and mocked. Where are the conference totes? WHERE ARE THE CONFERENCE TOTES?. As one of Andrew's dear colleagues, I can attest to the authenticity he has tried to create here.. it's canned lime perrier in the actual office though. Andrew Ishak when did you visit my office?. Andrew Ishak I just can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm not the only one with white boxes stashed in the corner from my last electronics purchase.... Omg this is so my office. psst almost everybody in the comments needs to... actually watch the video lol it's hilarious. This is one of the funniest things I‚Äôve ever watched. Am√©lie Daoust-Boisvert de pr√©cieux conseils pour la session d'automne !. Lucie Jenny j‚Äôai tellement ri... pensais-tu √† mon bureau ?(ahhh le stack de papier parce que le photocopieur est toujours vide üòÇ). Je me suis reconnue dans les vieilles tasses et les boites de tech vides !. Kerry Sagebiel ..... can you share this with HelenüòÇ I don‚Äôt have her on FB. the cravat üëå. Yessss!. They should call it a Zroom‚Ñ¢. Rahul Maganti. Claire Bang ready for school?. Miles Chan for my 5 AM classes? never been soooo excited to sleep in class in my life.

"New study shows how to get better RateMyProfessors ratings: Be White, male, tenured, or attractive","I remember my first student evaluations: 1) more short skirts 2) your hair looks so much better down 3) the psych building is too far away from my dorm room. I decided at this point that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my teaching. ‚Ä¶See More. Kristy M Keefe My first semester teaching I got two comments saying to ‚Äúwear less clothes‚Äù üò≥ As a new instructor this was not what I was expecting and not helpful in how I could improve as an educator. Sadly, this may have been the first time I received comments about my appearance but it was not the last.. Ugh! That's sexual harassment. I got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt, literally. Kristy M Keefe I had the opposite for the hair. My hair is long and I always wear it down. Student said that I either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is unprofessional.. Students will reach for anything when they want to be negative. One time a student asked me a question about the midterm, and I said I hadn't finished it yet. They mentioned that in my RMP rating, lol. Like they never procrastinate?. Amanda Carroll were you tempted to clap back with ‚Äòdo you mean fewer?‚Äô These sites are just nonsense.  Appalling levels of sexual harassment, and not just against women; I‚Äôve known male teachers have similarly inappropriate comments posted.. Kristy M Keefe For sure! üòä. Amanda Greubel nope. I have also had some wonderfully thoughtful comments about my courses. I‚Äôll take the bad with the good.. Angry people en route.... Joshua Shinn How dare you!I'm not angry, I just hate to disappoint anyone.. Being a good prof doesn't hurt either. Michael W. Hitch I had this one professor back in my college days that was, without a doubt, the best professor I ever had. His RMP ratings were trashed because he wasn't an easy A. A lot of us couldn't believe it because we loved him and he asked if w‚Ä¶See More. Michael W. Hitch dude, it doesn‚Äôt matter for some of us. Christ.. Being a good professor has nothing to do with good evaluations, and I would go so far to say that the effective professor does not get good reviews. Do be glib though.. üôÑ. Woosh. My teaching reviews, like my article reviews, fell neatly into thirds: one third - fantastic, no improvement needed; one third - ok but...; one third - who let this idiot leave his village? I suffered a bit because my undergrad subject was a demanding ‚Ä¶See More. The person paying for the service should be the one to decide how that service should be evaluated.If they want to judge it on financial merit or educational merit or social merit it‚Äôs up to them. ‚Ä¶See More. Stephen Cooper Setting aside the sneer in your comment, my point was of course that the principle of having one‚Äôs teaching evaluated is fine, but the execution ends up failing it‚Äôs purpose. I doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the stud‚Ä¶See More. My favorite criticism from a student on RMP: ‚Äúevery other professor wants you to succeed. She only cares about how much you learn.‚Äù The rest of the review made clear that ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù was just about a specific letter grade.Student evals usually tell us more about students than about teachers.. My favorite criticism on a student eval: ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt teach us the content, she expects us to learn it ourselves.‚Äù Apparently the fact that I don‚Äôt lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood teaching.‚Äù ü§¶üèª_‚ôÄÔ∏è. No kiddin'?You mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest.  I'll be damned.. You're not wrong.. Tenure > attractive, any day. Promote these large nostrils and heavy baggaged eyes please.. I won‚Äôt lie‚Äî the chili peppers are from my nephews. Should I remind that correlation does not mean causation?. Innokenty Kantor you seem to assume that universities hire more poorly qualified non-white non-males over better qualified white males, whereas in reality, the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against people who are more‚Ä¶See More. Innokenty Kantor thanks for explaining my comment for me. Yes because being male or white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges. The way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face bias.. Jacq Jones Not at all. I think it is the opposite: those who think that ANY disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination, are just burying their heads in sand. Because they don't like the implications.. Ransell D'Souza He was trying to write 'of course' in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as 'of cause.' Notice he also replaced the word hire with 'high.' It's probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof. Innokenty Kantor unless you are already hiring inferior candidates who happen to fit your bias - eg white men. In which case expanded the range of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires.. What's of cause?. Innokenty Kantor yes, it‚Äôs nice (apologies for not getting reference). I‚Äôd love to see this extended to include racial bias because, sadly, I think this would be even more pronounced. And the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at best.. Innokenty Kantor there seems to be a strong correlation that white men don‚Äôt believe academia is sexist and racist (backed up by several studies). Seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them,. the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their 'existing culture' (which is really just code for biases towards wht they THINK ideal candidates are like, and the d‚Ä¶See More. Issues with the methodology but not news.. I don‚Äôt even look anymore. You must not be an adjunct. I don‚Äôt want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs I apply to every year. Well, I get three out of four.. That‚Äôs how I do it. üòä. Wait there are adults who actually care about what's written on ratemyprofessor?. No of you should ever, under any circumstances, read Rate My Professor. No good comes of it.  And I FIRMLY believe there should be a ‚ÄúRate My Student‚Äù site. üòë. Mirrors typical life. I don't bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage.. Ditto. Especially after reading a rape fantasy.. I hope you reported that.. Bob Borrelli why? So they can all laugh about it? Pick up lines, graphic sexual fantasies, sexual assault and notes like ‚Äúpretty sure I found your house‚Äù were totally ignored.. Ta-Shana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you.. You brought it to our attention years ago. White? Yes. Male? No. Tenured? Hahaha. Attractive? Um.... Brenna E. Culbert. My favorite comment on RMP was ‚Äúshe has a lot of patience, even with the stupid question people.‚Äù. Amanda Evert they repeated your study.. Sarina Kilham. Thanks. Adding it to my stockpile of evidence.. Hadil Ghoneim here you go.. I'm attractive though üòÑüòÑ. White? Yes. Male? Yes? Tenured? No. Attractive? Not really. My RMP ratings still suck, although I have a few good ones.. Jess Moore, the most frequent descriptor people use for me is 'boring'. That one cuts me to my soul. I'm fun!. Brian Paul I agree and my ratings are largely good, and even the 'negative ones' are worthwhile üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Brian Paul I just got a bad review for giving too much work for a minimester class. I'm not even sure how to take that. Am I supposed to assign less work during a minimester? I was told you're supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now I wonder about that.. Aurora Le well shit. Ami Sedani new study! More like duh lol.  Lisa Parker Lebovitz. Daniel Malcom thanks! I‚Äôve got to get back to the data, I think we can refute this. Maybe the young white male faculty aren‚Äôt as attractive to students in pharmacy as in humanities...üòù. Francesca Bosisio!!!. My favourite bit of feedback received from a student, who scored my course a 0:'Please can there be better references, not of those written ages ago when they used sophisticated words'Cause who comes to university to learn sophisticated words? Lets u‚Ä¶See More. Harry Green Brilliant!. Bob Borrelli yeah fuck that guy and his sophisticated words :D. Who literally invented meteorology.. hey can you link the math paper using emoji? That would be awesome and I'd like to read it.This is a good one about emoji, but it's not written IN it, though it has some examples of retelling. https://www.languageatinternet.org/articles/2019/gawne. Well I am an unattractive, white female and get great reviews and teach  a  subject  that  is considered hard.. perhaps it would be profitable to spend some time studying statistics.. You fulfill one of the categories, then.. Goodüëèüèªforüëèüèªyouüëèüèª. I see you don't understand how studies work. A study never reports that in 100% of cases this happens, and in 0% of cases, this happened. If that were true, providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the study.Studies look at the way things tend to be. Maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but it's not a guarantee one way or the other still.. Funny: race and gender are wwwwaaaayyyyy less important than attractiveness, student interest and discipline, but the first two features in the headline is ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúmale‚Äù. Stop contradicting the facts with your divisive ideology!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Juan Trucupey cool story bro. Catherine Glass it‚Äôs easy to laugh when you‚Äôre the beneficiary. Juan Trucupey that‚Äôs not contradicting facts. It‚Äôs emphasising some things that the study found more than others. But I bet the standard of attractiveness and gender interact as well. Juan yes it's all propaganda; it's not like they're just pointing out the most interesting conclusions of the study rather than the obvious ones. Student interest in the subject influences professor ratings? Really? ü§™. Juan Trucupey You're the one who is claiming that it is sexist against males to imply that gender affects ratings before listing a student's interest in the subject matter. I never said that. So your complaint that I'm contradicting myself is wrong - i‚Ä¶See More. Propaganda, lol.. I literally have had female students look for profs who are called a bitch. It apparently means something different to people. Good to know. Those students just graduating with phds now, one went to Georgetown, another is a teacher..

short skirts 2 your hair looks so much better down 3 the psych building is too far away from my dorm room i decided at this point that student evaluations are not the definitive critique of my teaching kristy m keefe my first semester teaching i got two comments saying to wear less clothes as a new instructor this was not what i was expecting and not helpful in how i could improve as an educator sadly this may have been the first time i received comments about my appearance but it was not the last ugh that is sexual harassment i got one saying someone should make a calendar with pictures of my sexy butt literally kristy m keefe i had the opposite for the hair my hair is long and i always wear it down student said that i either needed to cut my hair or wear it in a bun because long hair is unprofessional students will reach for anything when they want to be negative one time a student asked me a question about the midterm and i said i had not finished it yet they mentioned that in my rmp rating lol like they never procrastinate amanda carroll were you tempted to clap back with do you mean fewer these sites are just nonsense appalling levels of sexual harassment and not just against women i have known male teachers have similarly inappropriate comments posted kristy m keefe for sure amanda greubel nope i have also had some wonderfully thoughtful comments about my courses i will take the bad with the good angry people en route joshua shinn how dare you i am not angry i just hate to disappoint anyone being a good prof does not hurt either michael w hitch i had this one professor back in my college days that was without a doubt the best professor i ever had his rmp ratings were trashed because he was not an easy a a lot of us could not believe it because we loved him and he asked if michael w hitch dude it does not matter for some of us christ being a good professor has nothing to do with good evaluations and i would go so far to say that the effective professor does not get good reviews do be glib though woosh my teaching reviews like my article reviews fell neatly into thirds one third fantastic no improvement needed one third ok but one third who let this idiot leave his village i suffered a bit because my undergrad subject was a demanding the person paying for the service should be the one to decide how that service should be evaluated if they want to judge it on financial merit or educational merit or social merit it is up to them stephen cooper setting aside the sneer in your comment my point was of course that the principle of having ones teaching evaluated is fine but the execution ends up failing it is purpose i doubt that such evaluations are even a good test of the my favorite criticism from a student on rmp every other professor wants you to succeed she only cares about how much you learn the rest of the review made clear that success was just about a specific letter grade student evals usually tell us more about students than about teachers my favorite criticism on a student eval she does not teach us the content she expects us to learn it ourselves apparently the fact that i do not lecture from the text and expect them to come to class having done the reading and prepared to engage in discussion and activities is not good teaching _ no kiddin you mean a popularity contest turns out to be like a popularity contest i will be damned you are not wrong tenure attractive any day promote these large nostrils and heavy baggaged eyes please i will not lie the chili peppers are from my nephews should i remind that correlation does not mean causation innokenty kantor you seem to assume that universities hire more poorly qualified non white non males over better qualified white males whereas in reality the whole point of diversity practices in hiring is to mitigate bias against people who are innokenty kantor thanks for explaining my comment for me yes because being male or white has never been shown to be the direct cause of very tangible privileges the way some of you do mental gimnastics to avoid having to face bias jacq jones not at all i think it is the opposite those who think that any disproportion is a result of bias or discrimination are just burying their heads in sand because they do not like the implications ransell dsouza he was trying to write of course in his comment over and over again but it kept coming out as of cause notice he also replaced the word hire with high it is probably a combination of using autocorrect and a complete lack of proof innokenty kantor unless you are already hiring inferior candidates who happen to fit your bias eg white men in which case expanded the range of people you consider will enhance the quality of your hires what is of cause innokenty kantor yes it is nice apologies for not getting reference i would love to see this extended to include racial bias because sadly i think this would be even more pronounced and the weighting often put on these for tenure is problematic at best innokenty kantor there seems to be a strong correlation that white men do not believe academia is sexist and racist backed up by several studies seems to point to a causality of their fear of losing status in a field biased towards them the most laughable part is the assumption that universities hire the best candidate rather than the one that most closely matches their existing culture which is really just code for biases towards wht they think ideal candidates are like and the issues with the methodology but not news i do not even look anymore you must not be an adjunct i do not want to look but have to submit them for the ten jobs i apply to every year well i get three out of four that is how i do it wait there are adults who actually care about what is written on ratemyprofessor no of you should ever under any circumstances read rate my professor no good comes of it and i firmly believe there should be a rate my student site mirrors typical life i do not bother with the actual university evaluations let alone this garbage ditto especially after reading a rape fantasy i hope you reported that bob borrelli why so they can all laugh about it pick up lines graphic sexual fantasies sexual assault and notes like pretty sure i found your house were totally ignored ta shana this kind of stuff always makes me think of you you brought it to our attention years ago white yes male no tenured hahaha attractive um brenna e culbert my favorite comment on rmp was she has a lot of patience even with the stupid question people amanda evert they repeated your study sarina kilham thanks adding it to my stockpile of evidence hadil ghoneim here you go i am attractive though white yes male yes tenured no attractive not really my rmp ratings still suck although i have a few good ones jess moore the most frequent descriptor people use for me is boring that one cuts me to my soul i am fun brian paul i agree and my ratings are largely good and even the negative ones are worthwhile brian paul i just got a bad review for giving too much work for a minimester class i am not even sure how to take that am i supposed to assign less work during a minimester i was told you are supposed to offer the same amount as a regular semester but now i wonder about that aurora le well shit ami sedani new study more like duh lol lisa parker lebovitz daniel malcom thanks i have got to get back to the data i think we can refute this maybe the young white male faculty are not as attractive to students in pharmacy as in humanities francesca bosisio my favourite bit of feedback received from a student who scored my course a 0 please can there be better references not of those written ages ago when they used sophisticated wordsecause who comes to university to learn sophisticated words lets harry green brilliant bob borrelli yeah fuck that guy and his sophisticated words d who literally invented meteorology hey can you link the math paper using emoji that would be awesome and i would like to read it this is a good one about emoji but it is not written in it though it has some examples of retelling well i am an unattractive white female and get great reviews and teach a subject that is considered hard perhaps it would be profitable to spend some time studying statistics you fulfill one of the categories then goodforyou i see you do not understand how studies work a study never reports that in 100 of cases this happens and in 0 of cases this happened if that were true providing one contrary story would be enough to destroy the findings of the study studies look at the way things tend to be maybe people who fulfill certain criteria are more likely to get positive reviews but it

sure that is not typical conversation at professional conferences my wife is a professor when she helps the children with their homework she insists her name is put on it as well because they did it in my house my name goes on it too if i agree with the sentiment of the joke but if i describe my own interpretation of it then it is mansplaining all over again i want women to not have to worry about this bullshit and have a great career and life without all of the male insensitivities funny how pervasive this joke is when introducing curricular changes and revisiting course descriptions these are always rejected until an ivy league later releases a press report for the need to change do not know if i should laugh or cry i am 68 and it is been happening forever it is like being invisible came here to repeat it to complete the joke and realized it does not work when i say it it is strange but ever since i was taught both chemistry and physics by two amazing women in high school and then taught many more chemistry classes in college by women professors the idea that women are scientists has never seemed remotely i just read that neil degrasse tyson wants astrophysics to be more popular than beyonce well making the study practice environment more inclusive shall assist with that he peating is so annoying but do you even understand physics or would you like a male commentator from an unrelated field explain it to you first oh you have a phd do you not sure what your point is whyigotout not that math is much better all my best ideas at work stolen by women but yeah okay this is a strictly male thing to do it works everywhere also outside physics and especially outside academia i have a question well it is more of a comment all the triggered men go i am also pretty crap at telling jokes but maybe your male colleague is more confident and can pull it off this comment is actually very sad and frustrating committee meetings what i said repeated not true but if good it is always worth stealing i am 84 been happening forever in the 60s my husband would ignore my idea steal it and proudly tell it then claim to have no memory of me saying it crazy making who needs gaslighting my favourite maths and science teachers were both female why would that be doctor nellist i felt this woman it is also what it is like being a man or woman and friends with hamed kasra milad omid i have literally had research ideas mathematical techniques plus accompanying code stolen from me by a senior physicist i think that this sort of thing happens increasingly frequently in this case it s an older more influential man exploiting a happens to me all the time but i am a guy i have a joke about being a woman in physics as not that the truth preach this is savage and so true ugh so true yes so true what clara nellist you are famous well nerd famous thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis this has actually happened 30 mins later tho hah ugh damn too good not to repost but am a cis

,"I was in a room full of faculty when we were supposed to stand up one by one, tell our name, department we‚Äôre from, and one or two sentences to state the topic of our research.

Why do capitalists hate full employment? Because it weakens their power over workers.,"They don't need to plan for unemployment, the just progressively eliminate human work in order to increase the profit share in the added value.. Marx explains that capitalists try to maintain a 'reserve army of the unemployed' to keep wages down. Yes and so socialists should make a Universal Job Guarantee at a living wage a transitional demand.. Wally Mooney if the JG is voluntary and is not a job created just to keep people working as a way to justify their earnings or even their lives I'm with you. Jobs should not be linked to wages if we want real freedom.. Will Eede Sure. I fully support the battle for a 4 day week also.. Reduce the working time without decreasing wages.That's what workers have been fighting for (and won) for decades, and that put more people to job.More people employed doesn't necessarily imply more wealth produced. It can also be a better repartition between workers of the time used to produce.. Wally, that was enlightening. Thank you.. shouldn't they like it because then they get to exploit more people?. Hanno Sauer I am not going to exert effort showing to you that your assumptions are just that, not logic. It is just not worth it under these conditions.. Brenton Eccles i will leave it to you to 'establish' that a guaranteed entitlement to X won't affect people's motivation to obtain X. Hanno Sauer That is a valid concern, and I think that is why we should be open to incrementalism, to having degrees of competitiveness in markets, etc. All I know is the current system in the US is far from ideal; the power businesses have over people is far too much.. Hanno Sauer the labour market relies on desperation to create downward pressure on wages: when people lack desperation, either because it's easy to find a new job or because wages are high, it puts that mechanism in jeopardy.. Capitalism requires arbitrage of labor: buying the worker's time cheap; selling the product of that work for more than the labor and materials cost; and pocketing the difference. The lower the standing rate of unemployment, the greater the threat to the capitalist's money machine.. Who says that? Because a polish philosopher suggested it in 1943?   What capitalist has ever said such a ridiculous thing?. Slavery was a full-employment system, so we must be careful what we wish for :/. They also don't offer their employees the option to unionize or participate as co-owners.. Shorter hours without loss of earnings is what we needA three day week would provide opportunity for more employees, with more leisure time, improved mental health  and a greater turnover with regard to production. So are you saying no one could ever be sacked under socialism?. Marcia Meiring We are saying that if you don't work well, you'll get help to work better and experience better working conditions.It also means quitting your job won't get you kicked in the street.

money making enterprise to get peoples attention that last bit about the us army seems iffy buddhism has had plenty of sects who were warriors that killed people buuuut i do not think thats the type of buddhist mindfulness the army is trying to promote lol employer provided health insurance does the same as does public education leave it to us to pervert a practice and turn it into the exact opposite of what it was daria yeah why make a profit on invented myths with baseless claims when we could have just left it to the cults and misguided true believers yes your spirit really shines

kozhipatt aditya frank undzog this is very frustrating i have been trying to connect with whatever spirituality i have but most of the advice i can find online is either corporate or clearly a cult william that is the fun problem with the word it is so overused and everyone means something completely different yet they never clarify with each other when discussing it mike lanier i get what you mean i do not mean spirituality in a literal sense but rather a sense of calm or peace with myself chris pollina we come into this world and we leave it alone sure you can spend time with other people along the way but it is impossible for them to walk on your path with you confronting this isolation is a big part of spirituality william walton case i recommend the book buddhism plain and simple by steve hagen no self help puffery no rituals pantheons or other esoteric issues to navigate just cuts right to the quick of what spirituality is really about and has a nice primer for a simple effective meditation technique that one really started me on my way casey burnett i disagree we come into this world in relationship with others we literally cannot be born or grow up or learn anything outside of relationship and plenty of people die with a sense of peace fellowship and togetherness rather cameron anderson thank you i was seeking lecture like that william there are plenty of legitimate monastic buddhist communities in the us chanelle flori yo alexandra tracy chavarriaga andr s y ez chavarriaga my company tours mindfulness and offers monthly wellness workshops lol that is why i showed the way europeans do vacation because i am very much advocating for less work and reorder hours to hire more people who need jobs like bipoc the nap ministry also advocated for less work overall mcbuddhism will not cut it we need more rest overall we should not be working so many hours religion adds layers of complexity and ritual to simple concepts to awe and control the masses capitalism does the same thing for profits related just like these godamn techies microdosing for productivity fuck you very much for completely missing the point you venal fucks my financial life has

White-collar crime is barely prosecuted in the United States. It‚Äôs time for that to change.,"Lol @ when trump is more progressive and democratic than any ‚Äúdemocrat‚Äù.. Ladan Ziaee cool fiction novel you got there.. i bet you think he‚Äôs rounder than the earth too. read anything about jair or Bolivia or like Castro or like literally read.. I mean, he actually is less conservative  than the DNC. I don't  like the direction he wants to push the country but you can't  deny he is pushing harder than thr DNC pushes for anything.. The corporate class is not in favour of prosecuting white collar crime, and neither are the politicians it funds. The first step is to eliminate political donations by corporations, but that will be a long, hard fight.. If Americans were really opposed to 'looting' , they should begin with these white collar 'looters'!. Do not ever expect to find judicial prosecution of those thugs.  The French Solution is the answer.. shouldnt we be abolishing prisons not filling them...?. Will M Hall there‚Äôs a massive difference between upstream and downstream crimes and we need to focus on these upstream corporate and white collar crimes that feed inequality and insecurity that cause the street crimes that are rightly identified as over-incarcerated.. If they're lucky. The corporatocracy having dispensed with Rule of Law invites sharper retribution. Sin is Sin and Crime is Crime. The Judge should be your concern. What is throwing them in jail gonna do? Lmao going to jail doesn't make people accountable for anything. It's been said that UK businesses claimed money under the job retention scheme and used it to pay their shareholders.   That would be a good place to start.. That's why no one blinked an eye when Stone and Manafort were released.. Prison is not harsh enough for many of these people.. Lol we can be confident this won't happen while Biden is president.. = Neoliberal Capitalism is criminally corrupt.... Isn't the left against the mass incarceration for non violent offences that feeds prison industrialization?. Ahmed O J Abdul Nah having the sheriff put you on the street because they sold you a fraudulent mortgage is non violent.  If people didn't want to get victimized by crooked bankers they would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and be more predatory themselves.. Byron Spencer, white collar crime is non-voilent? You can be a victim without being harmed physically.. Brett Norris I‚Äôm open to non carceral solutions but some solution that is a deterrent is required. Something that prevents future abuse and gives restitution to victims.. i am in full support the school to prison pipeline provided that the schools in question are mba programs. Glen Carpenter yup, start with Harvard and yale... Pamela Taylor-Horton Wharton School of Business at University of Pennsylvania, Trump's alma mater, first. üòâ. Glen Carpenter and ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù. We also need thousands more IRS agents. They pay for themselves.. And regulators of all industry and business. And HR departments that actually side with employees again.... Peter Breschard If the government wanted to do that, they would. They don't want to.. Even your article points out the IRS needs more funding to properly audit the wealthy. You need to read beyond the headlinr. YES YES YES. GR8 INVESTMENT.. It seems after Enron they found making people accountable was too hard on the economy.   That‚Äôs why they steal billions and only are fined. millions ... to protect the jobs of people.   Why not pay back every dollar they took plus a little more ?  I ‚Ä¶See More. When they scream 'law and order' they don't mean justice. The law oppresses the masses with order, and protects the crimes of the ruling elite that negatively impact society the most. The law is unjust in it's application of who the full power of the law goes after and who it ignores.. 'B-b-but what about the JOB CREATORS? YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS! You ENVY their success! You'll take away incentive to WORK! You'll make them want to LEAVE!' me: Hang them all.. Amen, amen, amen!!! We need justice!! For too long it has been excused. There is no incentive for doing the right thing anymore.. No - abolish prisons.. Yeah like CHEATING CORRUPT TRUMP!!. What happened to prison abolitionists lol. Wait, I thought we needed to #abolishprison?. Ca√´l Blomster abolish prison, and death penalty to white colar crimes üëç. The United States doesnt give a shit about crime.https://i.pinimg.com/.../c1b9ebca46cc6fd3f604501698dd7cf3.... But where to start? Hmm.... Lock Em Up!. *anywhere. Yes please. üá∫üá∏üßê. Sloppy headline on an otherwise so-so piece. It's disappointing to see a publication like Jacobin casually and thoughtlessly advocating for 'jail' when America is finally coming around to prison abolition. I say that as a reader, a fan, and a leftist, ‚Ä¶See More. Julianna McCorkle, prison abolition is a stupid proposal. Punitive justice and the bail system should be abolished alltogether. Prisons also needs to be reformed (which functions as a profit industry).. I don't think I'm following your logic. How would you abolish all 'punitive justice' (your words, not sure what you mean by that) but only 'reform' prisons, not abolish them? Wouldn't prisons be a subcategory of 'punitive justice' in your categorizatione. Julianna McCorkle Id agree with some of that. But ordering fines and restitutions dont seem to be doing a good job of keeping 'high level' corporate bad actors from committing malfeasance on large scales ü§∑üèª‚ôÇÔ∏è. We get that the DNC is awful, but these people are criminals unlike anything we might have seen in modern American history. Trump, and anyone involved with his administration need to be thoroughly investigated and charged if and or when any wrongdoing is found.. Chris Winter, not a single banker went to federal prison for 2008. To act like Democrats want to stamp out corruption is a farce. What you really desire is punishment based on political leanings.. Matthew Dahlberg I dont think so. Actually I dont see how you reached that conclusion at all. Obviously the issues transcend Obama, and Trump, and every other president, which is exactly the point that Im making. OP is saying that the Trump administ‚Ä¶See More. Oh, sorry, I guess I read it as just blaming Obama, when you were blaming the whole system. My b dude!. I think the disappearance of numerous citizens and the use of military force against citizens is a big difference. I‚Äôd say trumps recommendation to ‚Äòshoot‚Äô looters and squeeze out voting rights is different.The democrats suck, but let‚Äôs not pretend trump doesn‚Äôt wish to be a dictator.. Every structural problem in this country is because we never hold this one group of people really accountable for anything, honestly, this would be the only case where I feel capital punishment could achieve a broad social good.. As long as they committed a real crime, thats actually listed in the Criminal Code, either State or Federal.ALL criminals need to be accountable.. If they caused harm or injustice, that harm needs to be repaired, that injustice needs to be corrected, regardless of whether theres a piece of paper somewhere calling it a crime..

read beyond the headlinr yes yes yes gr8 investment it seems after enron they found making people accountable was too hard on the economy that is why they steal billions and only are fined millions to protect the jobs of people why not pay back every dollar they took plus a little more i when they scream law and order they do not mean justice the law oppresses the masses with order and protects the crimes of the ruling elite that negatively impact society the most the law is unjust in it is application of who the full power of the law goes after and who it ignores b b but what about the job creators you are just jealous you envy their success you will take away incentive to work you will make them want to leave me hang them all amen amen amen we need justice for too long it has been excused there is no incentive for doing the right thing anymore no abolish prisons yeah like cheating corrupt trump what happened to prison abolitionists lol wait i thought we needed to abolishprison ca l blomster abolish prison and death penalty to white colar crimes the united states doesnt give a shit about crime but where to start hmm lock em up anywhere yes please sloppy headline on an otherwise so so piece it is disappointing to see a publication like jacobin casually and thoughtlessly advocating for jail when america is finally coming around to prison abolition i say that as a reader a fan and a leftist julianna mccorkle prison abolition is a stupid proposal punitive justice and the bail system should be abolished alltogether prisons also needs to be reformed which functions as a profit industry i do not think i am following your logic how would you abolish all punitive justice your words not sure what you mean by that but only reform prisons not abolish them would not prisons be a subcategory of punitive justice in your categorizatione julianna mccorkle id agree with some of that but ordering fines and restitutions dont seem to be doing a good job of keeping high level corporate bad actors from committing malfeasance on large scales we get that the dnc is awful but these people are criminals unlike anything we might have seen in modern american history trump and anyone involved with his administration need to be thoroughly investigated and charged if and or when any wrongdoing is found chris winter not a single banker went to federal prison for 2008 to act like democrats want to stamp out corruption is a farce what you really desire is punishment based on political leanings matthew dahlberg i dont think so actually i dont see how you reached that conclusion at all obviously the issues transcend obama and trump and every other president which is exactly the point that im making op is saying that the trump oh sorry i guess i read it as just blaming obama when you were blaming the whole system my b dude i think the disappearance of numerous citizens and the use of military force against citizens is a big difference i would say trumps recommendation to shoot looters and squeeze out voting rights is different the democrats suck but let us not pretend trump does not wish to be a dictator every structural problem in this country is because we never hold this one group of people really accountable for anything honestly this would be the only case where i feel capital punishment could achieve a broad social good as long as they committed a real crime thats actually listed in the criminal code either state or federal all criminals need to be accountable if they caused harm or injustice that harm needs to be repaired that injustice needs to be corrected regardless of whether theres a piece of paper somewhere calling it a crime seems like they have a similar immunity as do the police funny how that works eh him and

"‚ÄúWomen have to work harder and longer to become principals, and the gender gap is even bigger for the jobs with the most power: superintendents.‚Äù","The problem is often that teaching and administration involves two separate skill sets. The attributes that make a good teacher do not necessarily make a good administrator and the inverse is true as well.. Sandy Gonsowski this is a very important point that is often overlooked.. Sandy Gonsowski but that makes sense some just don't get it in my opinion.. Sandy Gonsowski sure, but administrators need a working knowledge of what teachers do. Otherwise it‚Äôs like asking your barber to build you a house.. Sandy Gonsowski this is the same reasoning used to justify the lack of black coaches in the NFL. You‚Äôre basically saying women don‚Äôt have those skills. The number of contrarian trolls on here suggests to me that there‚Äôs something powerful, important and truthful in Brookings, and somebody is scared.

damage to other parts of my body well that is not exactly news to anyone nicholas hunter but its true balal magar rem yes of course it is true we have known it for three plus years i guess the interesting part is that it has now been confirmed by the republican led senate intelligence committee oh james brennan did not hack the dnc seth rich did not pass the leaked files to wikileaks and why nobody mentioned the rnc was hacked as well cause both parties got hacked we knew that but certain people refuse to acknowledge the truth i know we are supposed to believe that the president elect was not involved like his people who were on his team yet still remember him stating at a rally just before the wikileaks dump how something was coming and it did also find it difficult to well trump was having private conversations outside recorded calls sooooo this is why trump is against mail in ballots russia cannot cheat dnc does not need hack when they knew bernie will be president they hacked it themselves trump is crooked to the core and had to cheat to win just like he is trying to do now this article provides no evidence just hearsay forbes you suck forbes not a reliable source any more who owns forbes again the hacking is debunked and will be publicly soon itiswhatitisthis is old news amazing that it took the senate this long to finally get to this conclusion hey russia if you are listening i hope you can find the emails that day the russians attempted the first hack well what is there to do about it forbes should fire their social media director for putting out democratic propaganda from a once great free enterprise magazine the forbes must be ashamed here are the members of that senate committee comedy show continue bar mus be go to jail as soon as posible

get the picture pulling all stops just to get a demented old pedo and a flipflopping extremist elected how many times will people say say that trump was not part of cheating to win an election the republicans and democrats admit he cheated the senate intelligence committee concluded that the kremlin launched an aggressive effort to meddle in the 2016 that is so far from the truth it is unreal

,"Hopefully there‚Äôs a chapter on how he put thousands of infected people back into nursing homes to die when the president gave him thousands of beds in a hospital ship & turned a convention center into a hospital.. Todd Hardiman facts?. Keith Price as usual a Trump supporter talks garbage out of his ass without looking into a situation and circumstances, when his president said the virus is / hoax!!!What is wrong with you dude? Have you no desire for the truth? Is it too much work  to learn the truth ? Or are you a sheep that just regurgitates what you are being told by your not so supreme leader and his propaganda of Lies.. Keith Price provide proof otherwise you‚Äôre just like the 45th talking out of your a$$. Keith Price OMG you still don‚Äôt have your facts right! Unbelievable. Keith, you don‚Äôt think he will cover missteps and assumptions, of course he will, he is not Trump who already said he is not accountable.. Keith Price  nailed it!! Keep Forbes accountable! The people aren‚Äôt blind.. Keith Price he has blood on his hands yet he praises himself with the Democratic media.. Debbie Comerford wah wah. This!. Well the ship that showed up wasn‚Äôt taking covid patients at first. They were for overflow patients. Furthermore the HHS recommended sending the seniors back. So before you spout off, have your facts straight.. Keith Price Bot!. Sam A Nasr hes a bot. Keith Price that's the problem when people (sheeps) just believe what IQ45 says, these people would end like the Waco or Guyana following this Guy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Debbie Comerford ....if he did nothing just left it alone...we would have 11 thousand grandparents still with us. They after he realized what a disaster mistake it was he past law that u could not file a lawsuit against the state or nursing homes...Let‚Äôs investigate independently stop hiding all the details of this debacle. Keith Price He has taken responsibility and has taken us through this nightmare. He continues to work hard at keeping our COVID numbers below 1%. Maybe if Trump stopped saying it came to the US from China, we could have stopped it as it came in from Europe.. Keith Price   Yes!. Barbara Sausville Johnson dont forget now trying to profit from all those deaths, makes a nice story i guess.. Keith Price Troll. An uneducated one at that!. Keith Price reading that realize stupidity has no limits. I'm sure this will be 100% Accurate and Mention how NY still has the HIGHEST NUMBER of DEATHS!!!Give me a BREAK!  SUCCESS by what measure!  In his LITTLE MIND!. Donald Furr They had the highest because we didn‚Äôt know how to treat the disease at that point. We were trying the damn hydroxychloroquine which proved to be ineffective.  Fortunately, the rest of the country learns from their failures and successes.. Donald Furr and what did you do to help?. Donald Furr you seem like an ultra snowflake.  Calm down. Dolly Tewelis DePagter nice try Blame Trump!  Noone tried hydroxychloroquine in NY!  Your Liberal dumbass leaders were too busy sending infected people into nursing homes and crying/bitching about everything!  Highest Number of Deaths that is on Cuomo!!!. Donald Furr You must be a troll üòÇüòÇ. Angie Dixon tough measures? Like signing a law that forces COVID patients into nursing homes?. Donald Furr TROLL. Ordering positive Covid patients into nursing homes was not Trumps fault.. Two words: nursing homes!!. Says the man who has killed so many in NYC by his lack of leadership,intelligence and forcing nursing homes to take covid patients.  Also blocking any investigation into his murdering of innocent nursing home people.. Cuomo sentenced almost  20,000 people to their death in nursing homes, The old and most vulnerable among us had no power to stop Cuomo from mandating nursing homes admit Covid positive people. There were thousands of COVID-19 specific beds that the infected people could have recovered in at the arena, hospitals, and the Navy ship.  So about 20,000 people lost their lives because of Cuomo‚Äôs malfeasance.. Good he can explain why he murdered over 6,000 seniors in nursing homes with his mandate.. So he forced nursing homes to take covid patients. Last number I read, was 11k deaths in nursing homes...in his state of New York. People then try to open an investigation on that and he blocks it...obviously to cover up his massive mistake. Is that what he‚Äôs claiming leadership looks like? What a joke this guy is.. He literally killed thousands with his poor leader ship and decisions in policymaking look at Florida same amount of cases a 10th of the death. What's it called how to kill the most vulnerable? And then say I did a great job. so a man in office is publishing a book detailing government practices during a pandemic that killed millions is gonna profit from all this death and fear?? And he's aloud?. That was his plan all along once  COVID-19  showed up in New York and I bet Freddo his bother  will be the ghostwriter of his book.. Will he be talking about decimating the NY economy in the face of this pandemic?Cuomo is a joke.. It was Cuomos fault that he did not take measures to enforce strict quarantine and face masks, reduce movement and transport to reduce infection. No wo der NY has the highest rates of infection and deaths in the world.. I hope he will confess in the book how hydroxychloroquine cured his brother ... but he continues discrediting the cheap med that can save lives. Does it include him infecting nursing homes? Or the collapse of Americas largest city? NY is headed for collapse under Cuomo and DeBlasios watch. Step one, keep everything open and encourage life to go on. Step two, close everything and blame President for keeping  everything open. Step three, force nursing homes to take known cases of the virus knowing they lack the ability to isolate and car‚Ä¶See More. He‚Äôs clearly got plenty of free time since he doesn‚Äôt actually make any decisions himself.. Highest death rate of all states-great success story. All is a statistical game to fit his political agendas  and keep merdia fed with garbage.. A what NOT TO DO instruction manual.. He is crying for money ,he is going to need it with all the lawsuits from the seniors family members.. Will he talk about having money ties that made him mandate the elderly that tested positive return to their nursing home causing a lot of death all alone. So glad Florida knows how to take care of our elderly. He was the worst in the country lol. So capitalising off of death by selling books... I'm sorry but both sides are fucking useless...... For  those  new  yorkers  and  califonians  relocating  to  red  states  please  make  sure  you  leave  behind  ur  liberal and  stupid  mentality behind  .... With his experience, I hope his book is on ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù!!!. Will it include how he put COVID patients in nursing homes, which killed thousands and then he blamed it on others? Prospering on the death of others is sickening.. Will it be titled, How Democrats let me get away with murder.. Can always be used as Doorstop. You people realize cuomo can be trash and still be speaking the truth when it comes to trump right?. Re-writing history, by the FX channel oops no Cuomo has its own science fiction channel.. No one to blame for NY other than yourself and DiBlasio.. Is he going to tell how he killed.the elderly in nursing homes.. New York has the highest death toll in the country  üôÑ. Don‚Äôt forget to tell them about all the nursing home deaths for which you are responsible. That‚Äôs REAL leadership ‚Äì thinning the herd.. It wasnt that great..he worried about dearhs..but not deaths by abortion. Cartoon picture book? Hopefully comes with a lesson on state responsibility and a four pack of crayons.. Front cover of book should have a giant Q-tip shoved up his nose by his brother.  Great humor after the death of so many.. Maybe he can explain how NY was destroyed. No wonder he sucked at the handling of it...!? He was busy writing a book on how well he handled it!üòÇüòÇ. You literally had the worst outcomes of any state.  What a self absorbed a hole. ‚ÄúMy Little Book on How to Destroy the Greatest City in the World  in 6 Months‚Äù. A retrospective on murder,  mayhem, crime and corruption. It‚Äôs going to be a NY Times best seller. Chapter 1 -Killing the Elderly.. A comic book?. Sounds like a ‚ÄúHorror Story‚Äù. Of course it‚Äôs more likely a FICTION story since we know many of the true events.. I wonder if it mentions how he's concurrently working to cut Medicaid while giving tax breaks to help facilitate these cuts during the pandemic.. A comedy of errors?. Is there a chapter on how he killed thousands of elderly?. Is that what he‚Äôs been working on instead of taking leadership?. Ah folks, perhaps you might want to check on the numbers that have died, are dying, will die, in YOUR STATE.. The guy with the most deaths in his state? This is liberal insanity at its finest..

when the president gave him thousands of beds in a hospital ship turned a convention center into a hospital todd hardiman facts keith price as usual a trump supporter talks garbage out of his ass without looking into a situation and circumstances when his president said the virus is hoax what is wrong with you dude have you no desire for the truth is it too much work to learn the truth or are you a sheep that just regurgitates what you are being told by your not so supreme leader and his propaganda of lies keith price provide proof otherwise you are just like the 45th talking out of your a keith price omg you still do not have your facts right unbelievable keith you do not think he will cover missteps and assumptions of course he will he is not trump who already said he is not accountable keith price nailed it keep forbes accountable the people are not blind keith price he has blood on his hands yet he praises himself with the democratic media debbie comerford wah wah this well the ship that showed up was not taking covid patients at first they were for overflow patients furthermore the hhs recommended sending the seniors back so before you spout off have your facts straight keith price bot sam a nasr hes a bot keith price that is the problem when people sheeps just believe what iq45 says these people would end like the waco or guyana following this guy debbie comerford if he did nothing just left it alone we would have 11 thousand grandparents still with us they after he realized what a disaster mistake it was he past law that u could not file a lawsuit against the state or nursing homes let us investigate independently stop hiding all the details of this debacle keith price he has taken responsibility and has taken us through this nightmare he continues to work hard at keeping our covid numbers below 1 maybe if trump stopped saying it came to the us from china we could have stopped it as it came in from europe keith price yes barbara sausville johnson dont forget now trying to profit from all those deaths makes a nice story i guess keith price troll an uneducated one at that keith price reading that realize stupidity has no limits i am sure this will be 100 accurate and mention how ny still has the highest number of deaths give me a break success by what measure in his little mind donald furr they had the highest because we did not know how to treat the disease at that point we were trying the damn hydroxychloroquine which proved to be ineffective fortunately the rest of the country learns from their failures and successes donald furr and what did you do to help donald furr you seem like an ultra snowflake calm down dolly tewelis depagter nice try blame trump noone tried hydroxychloroquine in ny your liberal dumbass leaders were too busy sending infected people into nursing homes and crying bitching about everything highest number of deaths that is on cuomo donald furr you must be a troll angie dixon tough measures like signing a law that forces covid patients into nursing homes donald furr troll ordering positive covid patients into nursing homes was not trumps fault two words nursing homes says the man who has killed so many in nyc by his lack of leadership intelligence and forcing nursing homes to take covid patients also blocking any investigation into his murdering of innocent nursing home people cuomo sentenced almost 20 000 people to their death in nursing homes the old and most vulnerable among us had no power to stop cuomo from mandating nursing homes admit covid positive people there were thousands of covid 19 specific beds that the infected people could have recovered in at the arena hospitals and the navy ship so about 20 000 people lost their lives because of cuomos malfeasance good he can explain why he murdered over 6 000 seniors in nursing homes with his mandate so he forced nursing homes to take covid patients last number i read was 11k deaths in nursing homes in his state of new york people then try to open an investigation on that and he blocks it obviously to cover up his massive mistake is that what he is claiming leadership looks like what a joke this guy is he literally killed thousands with his poor leader ship and decisions in policymaking look at florida same amount of cases a 10th of the death what is it called how to kill the most vulnerable and then say i did a great job so a man in office is publishing a book detailing government practices during a pandemic that killed millions is gonna profit from all this death and fear and he is aloud that was his plan all along once covid 19 showed up in new york and i bet freddo his bother will be the ghostwriter of his book will he be talking about decimating the ny economy in the face of this pandemic cuomo is a joke it was cuomos fault that he did not take measures to enforce strict quarantine and face masks reduce movement and transport to reduce infection no wo der ny has the highest rates of infection and deaths in the world i hope he will confess in the book how hydroxychloroquine cured his brother but he continues discrediting the cheap med that can save lives does it include him infecting nursing homes or the collapse of americas largest city ny is headed for collapse under cuomo and deblasios watch step one keep everything open and encourage life to go on step two close everything and blame president for keeping everything open step three force nursing homes to take known cases of the virus knowing they lack the ability to isolate and he is clearly got plenty of free time since he does not actually make any decisions himself highest death rate of all states great success story all is a statistical game to fit his political agendas and keep merdia fed with garbage a what not to do instruction manual he is crying for money he is going to need it with all the lawsuits from the seniors family members will he talk about having money ties that made him mandate the elderly that tested positive return to their nursing home causing a lot of death all alone so glad florida knows how to take care of our elderly he was the worst in the country lol so capitalising off of death by selling books i am sorry but both sides are fucking useless for those new yorkers and califonians relocating to red states please make sure you leave behind ur liberal and stupid mentality behind with his experience i hope his book is on what not to do will it include how he put covid patients in nursing homes which killed thousands and then he blamed it on others prospering on the death of others is sickening will it be titled how democrats let me get away with murder can always be used as doorstop you people realize cuomo can be trash and still be speaking the truth when it comes to trump right re writing history by the fx channel oops no cuomo has its own science fiction channel no one to blame for ny other than yourself and diblasio is he going to

Rick Jones I know right. Their identity politics will be their demise.. Absolutely!!! Hopefully the Republican Party will come back more to his way of thinking!. Judy Bass Richardson no way he‚Äôs bitter because the republicans voted against him.  He‚Äôs not for Biden he‚Äôs anti Trump. Joe Hall you're going to need an extra adult diaper in November. Holly McCool Rice 8645!. Judy Bass Richardson no more RINOs.. He's not a Republican. In the end it is about policy,  so don't bank on it.. Judy Bass Richardson Thinking that electing a brain dead liberal and a Progressive shape shifter is a good idea? Who needs that kind of thinking?. Holly McCool Rice Right on!20 for treason and 20 for obstruction!. Why are Republicans speaking at the Democratic convention!!! No one wants to hear that!. Mr. Kasich and Mr. Sanders represent the heart and sole of the now defunct USSR, oh they they also share a common campaign donor - The Soros Family. Enjoy our leftovers. Might add a little depth to a dying party.. The democrats need to stop trying to be the republican party. The country doesn't need two consetvative parties. That's why their a bunch of loosers.. John Kasich is a republican I would vote for!. Ever since Forbes was bought by a Chinese company it has been becoming the new CNN (Chong‚Äôs News Network). Who would even really watch this is he really going to come out of the basement. The only people who like this guy are Democrats who agree with he's saying. Losers attract losers. Sanders has twice forfeited what was his. Great leader he is for sure. Kasich couldn‚Äôt even win his own state in the primary - can‚Äôt get much more pathetic than that.. Thank you for stepping up and putting the country first.. Kasich would have been a great President ..Top notch person.. Just join their party Kasich, it's that simple.  You're already on their team Teeing up Socialism.  Disgraceful.. This is the election to not think in terms of traditional party lines. This is not about republicans v DemocratsThis is a battle for common decency‚Ä¶See More. Losers, all of them! They belong with the democrats!. Never Trumpers should be support the libertarian candidate not the leftist and her token centrist.. Sanders lost cause,kasich misplaying his butt with his face.Betraying America.‚Ä¶See More. I'd have more success digging up the entire state of Ohio and moving it to the coast.. The irony of a Chinese magazine announcing a RINO announcing support for Biden support is outstanding. ü§î. Even the Republicans can see how worthless Trump is.. Unstable He can't make up his mind. They won't let biden leave the basement. Politics makes strange bedfellows.. I would have voted for him last election! Moderate views and knows bipartisan is the only way to move this country forward united!. Evil !From the Dark Swamp !!!. He may find a seat in the cabinet.  That would be crushing blow to Republicans. The Democrats have broadened their support as the Republicans become the party of the Klan and curly Qanon. Lining up the comedians and traitors.. Kasich is the man to do it, he is a true lying Democrat in a Rhino suit. Just don‚Äôt be a sheep.. Disappointed with the DNC, Kasich and this crew are not considered influential outside the liberal wing of the RNC and independents.. Kasich is a sore loser and a life long politician.. Country over party.... Will Mitt Romney be showcased too? The problem with neocons is they are too vain and full of themselves to notice that both sides despise them. Enjoy your 15 minutes. And finally, go away!. Maybe Kasich can run as a moderate Democrat next cycle.. You are a presidential candidate loser  who cares what you say not changing  my mind. Trump 2020!. I wish John Kasich was running again.. No one will be watching!. John, doesn‚Äôt Joe lie about golfing and about everything else?  (RNC 2012). Kasich is still butt sore from 2016. He‚Äôs always been a good guy regardless of party.. He still cannot get over he is a loser and no one cares what he says!!!  Worst Governor Ohio ever had.  When he speaks I will wager that the evening viewership ratings will drop off the chart.. Shows the depth of the Swamp.Forbes, you didn't think this through.  But we are to look to you for financial advice?. Sadly Biden cant pitch himself because it would be too apparent  how he is even more incoherent than Trump is.. Is Bernie related to the Colonel?. John Kasich and Reek? Lol how out of touch is the Democratic party?. 'Mr. Trump I voted for you. Your lack of leadership, lack of statesmanship, compassion and intelligence and your childlike mentality have moved me to never support you again'.Sane America.. He won't change one vote one way or the other. If Democrats actually read about John Kasich's policies they would want nothing to do with him.Bet he run for the GOP nomination in 2024 and the left shits all over him..

do not be a sheep disappointed with the dnc kasich and this crew are not considered influential outside the liberal wing of the rnc and independents kasich is a sore loser and a life long politician country over party will mitt romney be showcased too the problem with neocons is they are too vain and full of themselves to notice that both sides despise them enjoy your 15 minutes and finally go away maybe kasich can run as a moderate democrat next cycle you are a presidential candidate loser who cares what you say not changing my mind trump 2020 i wish john kasich was running again no one

"The dominant economic theory of the 1990s and 2000s‚Äîa synthesis of keynesianism and Friedmanism‚Äîtook a wobble after the financial crisis. Now, it has reached its limit","You need to introduce fat tails distributions !!! Plus quantative easing inefficiency... And add up more about bubbles and cognitive bias. More more not the least put endogenous extreme events regime into the models.... Keynesian theses could not produce a new synthesis model with monetarist antitheses. because they both guarded mainstream economics. A real synthesis will take place as a result of the struggle of opposing views. The theoretical struggle within mainstream economics continues to ignore economic facts. Economically, the real struggle is fighting poverty and increasing the welfare of countries.. It isn't prompting a rethink.

The concern that minimum wages destroy jobs has its roots in the principles of supply and demand.

The major benefit of the minimum wage is job satisfaction and retention of the employees and it also demotivate the efficient employees who are looking for the better job opportunities.. People on a minimum wage need the money and will spend it. Makes the economy work better and faster.. Not like rich, just buying assets and shares thus increasing their value away from min wage people, then leveraging rents from min wage people... Must increase min wages...

We live in a country where 2/3 of our economy is based on the consumerism, with 80% of our working class living paycheck to paycheck. It‚Äôs gonna collapse.. The concern for a higher minimum wage is that billioanires will have to pay their employees somewhere close to what they produce and not rob them blindly with absolutely no restrictions..

The newspaper tycoon is the most high-profile of the handful of arrests so far made under Hong Kong's new national-security law,"As well as Google, fb's, twitter's, censorship are also blows to free speech..

Imagine thinking that he was the reason tourism and investment stayed away.Hopefully they stay even further away now that it is clear China has no interest in allowing any semblance of free thought.. Good, the economist is anti-Chinazi this time Not sure for the next post. The truth of CCP can never see daylight, that's why they have to clamp down any elements that seek to expose their evil deeds. You can't expect a police state to have free speech. Just ask China. There's no free speech in Hong Kong, nor will there ever be.. CCP is fearful of the opinions of Chinese ? Nothing is popular in this party and their leader looks like dictator Loukachenko style.. That is what Trump did. Arrest him.. Nothing to do with free speech. He was arrested for advocating Hongkong separation from Motherland and funding violent demonstrations in collusion with foreign agents from America and UK.. The fascist party of china want to round up any one who does not agreed with Queen Xi.. #BDSChina Boycott. divest, sanction China. Free speech or fake news. He literally colluded with foreign powers which is at the heart of this national security law.  How would the US react if Rupert Murdoch asked Russia for help overthrowing the US government?. Dr Sun. It‚Äòs ridiculous to call this a law. Law means nothing to the CCP, it‚Äòs just another way to dominate and do whatever it wants. Mr. Lai is an impressive person: instead of fleeing from Hong Kong he stands for freedom, for the true Hong Kong, a free and prosperous city. The CCP now cast darkness over the city.. Free Speech, is not about spreading terrorism! Homeland Security Act in USA has same laws. If you support peaceful protest, we can still be friends.

Which form of exercise burns the most calories? @[The Economist‚Äôs 1843 magazine] crunched the numbers,"i used to run 5k in 25 minutes,  but 8 months ago i had patellofemoral pain sundrome (IT band) , still not yet recovered ,  after every 2 to 3km jogging now i feel pain in right knee.Before my weight was 84kg and now 110kg. I would suggest and advice everybody to have a balanced running routine to avoid injury.. Left over right, right over left stretches prior to running will fifx the IT band pain.  Cross your feet over each other, bend at the waist.  Lean to either side until you feel the slight pull down the IT band.. Jeff Harris thanks i will do these streches, i feel pain mostly when i bend the knee otherwise it is normal. Why is ice skating ranked so high?? They should qualify that by saying competitive figure skating.  Slowly going around Rockefeller Plaza seems less strenuous than vacuuming.. I have to agree with this; I‚Äôve lost 80 pounds and during that time I tracked which one made me lose weight the most; I tried HIIT, Swimming, Biking, Boxing, Muay Thai, Dutch Style Kickboxing. And out of all of them, the one that made me lose weight was running 5 miles a day.. Running is cruel and unusual punishment. üò£üòÇ. If you want to lose weight quickly, stop over eating.  Most people consume entirely too many calories for their sedentary lifestyle.. Swimming is the best. It burns more calories than jogging and it isn't harmful to your joints. I doubt their numbers are correct. Want to be even more efficient? Alternate between swimming and cycling.. Exercise is only 30% effective compared to diet. 3000 calories loses 1 lb.. I used to run till I injured my knee. Now I power walk 6 kmüòé. The body doesn't burn calories, it exhales them.. Walking is just as good for the same distance covered..

"W. E. B.

At the time, Garvey led the largest, in the millions, and most unified Black/Negro activist collective in the Western world. A feat, to date, no one has ever duplicated. In contrast, feeling less relevant and jealous of Garvey, Du Bois, an ‚Äúintellectual,‚Äù resorted to racist, White beauty standard inspired name-calling. Years later, much too late for Garvey to benefit, who had since died (he was eventually set-up and deported), after it became crystal clear to Du Bois that his belief in White benevolent partnership with Black liberation struggle was flawed, he would regret how he treated Garvey.  He finally had to admit to himself that Garvey was right, and, contaminated by Whiteness, he was wrong.  A part of how Du Bois atoned for his behavior was to leave his so-called high-brow academic perch, and move to Ghana, West Africa.  He became a true Pan Africanist, living the rest of his life surrounded by first-blood Africans, that he realized were quite beautiful.   Today, we can all honor Dr. Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr.","DuBois really made a huge shift from his liberalism to embracing Pan-Africanism and communism. He even had a good laugh with Mao.

On July 28, 1848 4; a typical day's food shipments from only the following four ports: from Limerick: the ANN, JOHN GUISE and MESSENGER for London; the PELTON CLINTON for Liverpool; and the CITY OF LIMERICK, BRITISH QUEEN, and CAMBRIAN MAID for Glasgow. This one-day removal of Limerick's food was of 863 firkins of butter; 212 firkins, 1,198 casks and 200 kegs of lard, 87 casks of ham; 267 bales of bacon; 52 barrels of pork; 45 tons and 628 barrels of flour; 4,975 barrels of oats and 1,000 barrels of barley.  From Kilrush: the ELLEN for Bristol; the CHARLES G. FRYER and MARY ELLIOTT for London. This one-day removal was of 550 tons of County Clare's oats and 15 tons of its barley.  From Tralee: the JOHN ST. BARBE, CLAUDIA and QUEEN for London; the SPOKESMAN for Liverpool. This one-day removal was of 711 tons of Kerry's oats and 118 tons of its barley.  From Galway: the MARY, VICTORIA, and DILIGENCE for London; the SWAN and UNION for Limerick (probably for transshipment to England). This one-day removal was of 60 sacks of Co. Galway's flour; 30 sacks and 292 tons of its oatmeal; 294 tons of its oats; and 140 tons of its miscellaneous provisions (foodstuffs). British soldiers forcibly removed it from its starving Limerick, Clare, Kerry and Galway producers.  In Belmullet, Co. Mayo the mission of 151 soldiers 5 of the 49th Regiment, in addition to escorting livestock and crops to the port for export, was to guard a few tons of stored meal from the hands of the starving; its population falling from 237 to 105 between 1841 and 1851. Belmullet also lost its source of fish in January, 1849, when Britain's Coast Guard arrested its fleet of enterprising fishermen ten miles at sea in the act of off-loading flour from a passing ship. They were sentenced to prison and their currachs were confiscated. The Waterford Harbor British army commissariat officer wrote to British Treasury Chief Charles Trevelyan on April 24, 1846; ""The barges leave Clonmel once a week for this place, with the export supplies under convoy which, last Tuesday, consisted of 2 guns, 50 cavalry, and 80 infantry escorting them on the banks of the Suir as far as Carrick."" While its people starved, the Clonmel district exported annually, along with its other farm produce, approximately 60,000 pigs in the form of cured pork.","Physically painful to remember.

hates and is intimidated by strong intelligent women does he do anything besides mock people someone is running scared so they run their mouth and vomit all over the country he gets more stupid by the day we have her back but as you all know he cannot touch her i am sorry as a supposedly grown man that you are still a childish bully it really tells you alot when they have top republicans speaking at the democratic convention why in the h do people think this is acceptable behavior from a president so tired of this repetitious whining and lying and demeaning of women just go away january 20th far far away i would pay a shitload of money to watch a debate between michelle and melania i want a decent person as potus not someone who committed treason to be placed in the office in the first place he should be disqualified to run again and the mud slinging continues it is really sad when the negative comments are all you have got he makes fun of everyone only thing he knows how to do certainly cannot lead intelligently can this man not do anything besides name calling i agree he is no role model for children we can tell that by his own children,"{'cannot': {'score':

Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself.,"And Joe Biden sent condolences...if it were the other way around tRump would not have said a word!. Cherie Colbert Garcelon LOL! That's right!. Gerry Karagrozia so  glad  you  got  the  sarcasm  and  didn‚Äôt  start  yelling  at  me. Victoria Vacher oh yes, trump might have said something mean, he can‚Äôt restrain himself from being mean.. Victoria Vacher class, it's called class. Victoria Vacher he‚Äôd have been too busy playing golf.  Cheating on every stroke demands his complete attention.. Victoria Vacher exactly. Victoria Vacher no he wouldn‚Äôt have, but we have to be better than trump. Victoria Vacher truth. Victoria Vacher so true. Victoria Vacher absolutely true.. Victoria Vacher your right not a word. Ernesto Amaya if it were the other way around, Trump would have made it about himself. He can't help but be that way.. You are correct ,..look how the little cry baby treated John Lewis‚Äôs death !. Yvonne Jimenez Kelly yup low class. Victoria Vacher  the  Other way around Trump would have said a nother good Democrat( Remember he said the only good Democrat was a dead one). Victoria Vacher what is new he (#45) only cares about himself. Victoria Vacher exactly. Victoria Vacher probably true but saying the words does mean shit.. Victoria Vacher  You got that right!. Victoria Vacher you are full of B's and liberal hate you should seek help. Barb Nowitzke the fact that you find this funny proves my point... Yer low class!!. Victoria Vacher. Victoria Vacher yes!  tRump would have probably said something derogatory (per his history of this degrading mentality) about his personality or past  hoping to make himself look better.. Victoria Vacher , that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt give a damn. I have no sympathy or compassion.. Victoria Vacher very true. Victoria Vacher Biden shows class. DumF is just an ass. Victoria Vacher Absolutely true!. Victoria Vacher shows that human beings have compassion unlike.... Victoria Vacher I agree with you. Biden knows respect and dignity.  He is able to feel empathy.  He is what we are needing.. Victoria Vacher SO TRUE. No empathy or compassion, even for his own family.. Mary HG nothing, he not human he is the devil. Mary HG   Went to the movies when his older brother Freddie passed away.. Anti-Christ. what a piece of crap.  Doesn't even care about his own family.  Only cares about himself.  Even before the country he was sworn to defend.. Condolences to the family. Who may have told the COVID denier that his in and out trip to NY was reported and he can't come back unless he quarantines for 14 days (and masks).just like all citizens who have ill relatives.. so sad for this family!  Cold and evil, one shouldn't be surprised as to what trump, donnie j is.  An empty soul!!  And the saga goes on!!!  I think Mary Trump tried to stop it!. It's so obvious....he cares for no one, no one... not even family... only himself.  That's why he hasn't and never can do anything of value for this country. His only focus is on himself, and those who support him are abetting the destruction of our country.. I thought he said they were close,that his brother was his best friend.. one day that our Criminal President will be behind bars for the rest of his crappy life...and including his family and cabinet members as well.... Bring civility back to the US, it is a great country but it is running into disrepute under this man. He is to the US what King Herod was to babysitting!!!!. Trump is a malignant narcissist. They cannot feel empathy, and see people, everyone as objects to be used  in their favor. Sure, Trump loved his brother as anyone loves a brand new computer or car. When it goes defective... Trump loves no one. Not even himself. His inability to feel love is the root of his personality disorder.. Joe Biden should showed he can put politics aside in a time of family. Joe Biden is a bigger man he put politics aside and did the right thing and sent condolences to Trmup for he's  brothers death.. .....which makes one cringe that his avid supporters have the same mindset. A scary proposition of non-caring and unintelligent.. Sounds like Donald. All about himself.. That should tell his children something.. He said he was his best friend he really doesn‚Äôt care about anybody but himself. Nobody is as important as he thinks he is!! He doesn't has no empathy or sympathy.. No one should be surprised....he's right out there, showing the world who and what he is, a VILE individual, less than VERMIN!!!!!. He's a sociopath he didn't care about his brother and he sure as hell doesn't care about America or the American people.. R I P , Robert Trump, I don't know you ,but I probably care more than your brother ,who went to the movies and played golf what a  disgrace he is. Oh but ... Him being there instead of on the golf course wasn't as important as being on the golf course costing the taxpayers more money. The man is focused only on himself!  Completely incapable of thinking of anyone else!  No compassion, no feelings, nothing!  He never disappoints with his low life behaviors!!ü§¨üí©ü§Æü§¨üí©ü§Æ. trump is a hollow shell. He has no feelings except for hate, lust and greed. Isn't it good to know that personal tragedy does NOT get in the way of his other pursuits?  What a sleaze!!! üëπ. He was afraid that he would get stuck with the funnersl bill. Nothing is surprising regarding this narcissistic sociopath with no conscience or decency. Good night and good luck. Vote Blue  for  two great people of character and kindness, and don‚Äôt forget competence.. If that's how he treated the death of his brothers, why do we think it would affect him in any way when almost 170,000 Americans died. NOT HIS RELATIVES OR RICH FRIENDS!!!!!!!. A very lonely,very ill, individual,who should be removed from positions and places so not to endanger himself and others!!. He did visit him. Donald Trump visited Robert in the hospital just one day before his death. Trump paid a visit to his ailing brother, Robert, on Aug. 14. The POTUS Wannabe was at Manhattan‚Äôs New York-Presbyterian Hospital for less than an hour that Fr‚Ä¶See More. Golf is his Best friend  any human caring person would never leave the hospital if a family member or close friend were dying. What he cares about...... Nothing  about  this  man  surprises  me  anymore.    He is  completely   devoid of  normal  human  feelings.. When I heard that his brother and best friend had died, I checked the news. Nope! Putin‚Äôs still alive.. Sitting at the bedside and offering comfort to your family vs flying off to private resort and playing golf. Priorities are a choice.. Golf,golf,golf. He‚Äôs working sooo hard. What‚Äôs that costing the taxpayers? Get him out, and take away his money. So then he can play on Public Courses.. Out playing golf with a has been football player, that personally I‚Äôve never heard of, while his brother and best friend is in hospital dying??  That is one heartless Mother!!  ü§Ø. Surprised anyone?   I thought maybe it would slow him down but he has to compete with the Dem convention and make sure he steals the show somehow.   In Mary's book, you see what a rotten, lousy son, brother, friend, whatever, he really is.   What decent person goes golfing when his brother dies?. I cannot imagine my best friend or brother with me close by choosing to golf or go to a movie instead of being there for them as they go through this scary transition. It really defies normal means of behavior.. And cause of death unknown. Bet it's Covid and Trump will make sure it will never be revealed as such. It would make him look bad if his lack of action killed a family member.. So sad to be emotionally alone....no matter how many people are around him he is just in this little   bubble of solitude....kind of like a padded room .... No surprise, he‚Äôs an evil monster!. He does not have a single redeeming quality. He is a monster.. Shhh??? He was working hard to spend our hard earned dollars. His hip swing is very important than his dying brother!. I‚Äôm not excited about his brother‚Äôs death.I will be very excited if it‚Äôs the other way around.He said they will see each other again,I wish it will be soonü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. This guy has no soul.. I guess I will play golf when they announce Trump's death: and none too soon!. Melania‚Äôs coat Comes to mind . I don‚Äôt really care, do you? Not my thought! But that coat and what the hell inspires one to design it. Not to mention wearing it!. So much for his best friend!. Look at the glee on this evil orange gargoyle... Ugh! ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. Look up qualities of a narcissist: LACKS EMPATHY is one.. If he doesn‚Äôt care about his brother‚Äôs dead, why would he care about the 170,000 Americans lost to the COVID-19.

sarcasm and did not start yelling at me victoria vacher oh yes trump might have said something mean he cannot restrain himself from being mean victoria vacher class it is called class victoria vacher he would have been too busy playing golf cheating on every stroke demands his complete attention victoria vacher exactly victoria vacher no he would not have but we have to be better than trump victoria vacher truth victoria vacher so true victoria vacher absolutely true victoria vacher your right not a word ernesto amaya if it were the other way around trump would have made it about himself he cannot help but be that way you are correct look how the little cry baby treated john lewiss death yvonne jimenez kelly yup low class victoria vacher the other way around trump would have said a nother good democrat remember he said the only good democrat was a dead one victoria vacher what is new he 45 only cares about himself victoria vacher exactly victoria vacher probably true but saying the words does mean shit victoria vacher you got that right victoria vacher you are full of bs and liberal hate you should seek help barb nowitzke the fact that you find this funny proves my point yer low class victoria vacher victoria vacher yes trump would have probably said something derogatory per his history of this degrading mentality about his personality or past hoping to make himself look better victoria vacher that is why i do not give a damn i have no sympathy or compassion victoria vacher very true victoria vacher biden shows class dumf is just an ass victoria vacher absolutely true victoria vacher shows that human beings have compassion unlike victoria vacher i agree with you biden knows respect and dignity he is able to feel empathy he is what we are needing victoria vacher so true no empathy or compassion even for his own family mary hg nothing he not human he is the devil mary hg went to the movies when his older brother freddie passed away anti christ what a piece of crap does not even care about his own family only cares about himself even before the country he was sworn to defend condolences to the family who may have told the covid denier that his in and out trip to ny was reported and he cannot come back unless he quarantines for 14 days and masks just like all citizens who have ill relatives so sad for this family cold and evil one should not be surprised as to what trump donnie j is an empty soul and the saga goes on i think mary trump tried to stop it it is so obvious he cares for no one no one not even family only himself that is why he has not and never can do anything of value for this country his only focus is on himself and those who support him are abetting the destruction of our country i thought he said they were close that his brother was his best friend one day that our criminal president will be behind bars for the rest of his crappy life and including his family and cabinet members as well bring civility back to the us it is a great country but it is running into disrepute under this man he is to the us what king herod was to babysitting trump is a malignant narcissist they cannot feel empathy and see people everyone as objects to be used in their favor sure trump loved his brother as anyone loves a brand new computer or car when it goes defective trump loves no one not even himself his inability to feel love is the root of his personality disorder joe biden should showed he can put politics aside in a time of family joe biden is a bigger man he put politics aside and did the right thing and sent condolences to trmup for he is brothers death which makes one cringe that his avid supporters have the same mindset a scary proposition of non caring and unintelligent sounds like donald all about himself that should tell his children something he said he was his best friend he really does not care about anybody but himself nobody is as important as he thinks he is he does not has no empathy or sympathy no one should be surprised he is right out there showing the world who and what he is a vile individual less than vermin he is a sociopath he did not care about his brother and he sure as hell does not care about america or the american people r i p robert trump i do not know you but i probably care more than your brother who went to the movies and played golf what a disgrace he is oh but him being there instead of on the golf course was not as important as being on the golf course costing the taxpayers more money the man is focused only on himself completely incapable of thinking of anyone else no compassion no feelings nothing he never disappoints with his low life behaviors trump is a hollow shell he has no feelings except for hate lust and greed is not it good to know that personal tragedy does not get in the way of his other pursuits what a sleaze he was afraid that he would get stuck with the funnersl bill nothing is surprising regarding this narcissistic sociopath with no conscience or decency good night and good luck vote blue for two great people of character and kindness and do not forget competence if that is how he treated the death of his brothers why do we think it would affect him in any way when almost 170 000 americans died not his relatives or rich friends a very lonely very ill individual who should be removed from positions and places so not to endanger himself and others he did visit him donald trump visited robert in the hospital just one day before his death trump paid a visit to his ailing brother robert on aug 14 the potus wannabe was at manhattans new york presbyterian hospital for less than an hour that golf is his best friend any human caring person would never leave the hospital if a family member or close friend were dying what he cares about nothing about this man surprises me anymore he is completely devoid of normal human feelings when i heard that his brother and best friend had died i checked the news nope putins still alive sitting at the bedside and offering comfort to your family vs flying off to private resort and playing golf priorities are a choice golf golf golf he is working sooo hard what is that costing the taxpayers get him out and take away his money so then he can play on public courses out playing golf with a has been football player that personally i have never heard of while his brother and best friend is in hospital dying that is one heartless mother surprised anyone i thought maybe it would slow him down but he has to compete with the dem convention and make sure he steals the show somehow in marys book you see what a rotten lousy son brother friend whatever he really is what decent person goes golfing when his brother dies i cannot imagine my best friend or brother with me close by choosing to golf or go to a movie instead of being there for them as they go through this scary transition it really defies normal means of behavior and cause of death unknown bet it is covid and trump will make sure it will never be revealed as such it would make him look bad if his lack of action killed a family member so sad to be emotionally alone no matter how many people are around him he is just in this little bubble of solitude kind of like a padded room no surprise he is an evil monster he does not have a single redeeming quality he is a monster shhh he was working hard to spend our hard earned dollars his hip swing is very important than his dying brother i am not excited about his brothers death i will be very excited if it is the other way around he said they will see each other again i wish it will be soon this guy has no soul i guess i will play golf when they announce trumps death and none too soon melanias coat comes to mind i do not really care do you not my thought but that coat and what the hell inspires one to design it not to mention wearing it so much for his best friend look at the glee on this evil orange gargoyle ugh look up qualities of a narcissist lacks empathy is one if he does not care about his brothers dead why would he care about the 170 000 americans lost to the covid 19 that is evident that he is not loyal not even to his

This is just sickening.,"I believe he is paying Putin by moving troops out of Europe...lifting sanctions, giving him classified information and turning a blind eye to his meddling in elections. As well as paying senate republicans for their cooperation..ie Russians built a plant in McConnell back yard...little insensitive like that to follow the leader. Kathleen Fils well stated. Someone said, a very long time ago I must add, that every time you see Trump do something that seems totally nuts, does not make sense, is not to the benefit of the US, whatever, stop and ask yourself one question -- how does this help Russia?  If it does in fact provide a benefit to Russia, then everything you thought Trump did that was crazy suddenly makes perfect sense.. Dana Ferraro üëç. What is even more sickening is the people who support him really and truly do not care and they will still vote for him....He is a God in their eyes.. Of course he knew about Everyone in government knew.We need to save our country from all the currupt government.We have to bring back our beautiful country back again.That is why we have to vote for Joe Biden. and Kamala Harris, to save our country.God Bless America.. A good amount of trumps wealth comes from Russia, and that was before the election. He has too much to personally lose if he stands up to Putin, so he never does. Such a wimp.. Being swept under the rug  just like all his criminal actions all his life.. a president is informed of every little thing in the world! he knew!and let it happen.for the sake of America,stand up to the con/murderer of Americans/chicken sh** of a man and under-educated wanna-be dictator!. This should be alarming to all Republicans!  Trump works for Putin and loves to play dumb.  If you vote for trump,  you will be living in  communist Russia next year! üíô üíô. Everyone else knew too and they are just as guilty as he is. They are so afraid of losing their well paying jobs and their high rank positions and all the perks that comes with it that they sit back in silence and say nothing. We already know that he c‚Ä¶See More. Just like Covid 19Decapatare him?Stonehim?‚Ä¶See More. Doesn‚Äôt matter his base doesn‚Äôt care about that even though he had a lot of people killed. He knows 1000/day are dying from Covid, and he sold PPE to Russia.Posimpotusputinoffice. He‚Äôs not concerned he‚Äôs trying to get re elected. So him and his family of grifters can continue to rape the tax payers and Trash our medical insurance and social services. I wouldn't be surprised if he's getting a kickback on each bounty. That would explain a lot, and be right in character for this heartless conman.. And the entire GOP, in all of their 'ball less' glory elected to ignore it as well.   I guess if it had been a sleeveless dress on FLOTUS Michelle, or POTUS Obama did this, the Senate would have been all over it.  The BIG FLUSH is coming on Nov. 3rd.........Eliminate them all and let's start over with uncorrupted replacements who are actually patriots.. Except numerous US intell agencies,British intell, Israeli intell and at least 2 members of Taliban along with a member of his administration have proven otherwise.. He truly doesn‚Äôt care.  Thank you for your services even under these circumstances.. And yet the GOP Senate is not demanding answers. Why?  We should all responsible for it. Our troops are not COLLATERAL DAMAGE.. Of course he knew and his traitorous acts against our military members should not go unpunished.. If a democrat President let this happen do you suppose republicans would still ignore it the way they have?. And that would surprise us....why? It‚Äôs typical Trump. Expect the worst from him and he will never let you down. If anything, he‚Äôll astound you with how low he can sink.. This is sickening!! I pray everyday that our sons and daughters are kept out of harms way !! Vote Blue üò°üá∫üá∏. Wait for malaria to get her I really don‚Äôt care coat because neither of them do. He's been a traitor since before he was president, common knowledge...OK now everyone mentally abuse me like normal do you all feel better.... I could not agree more.  Even if Trump himself ignores or does not read his Intelligence Briefings, somebody, somewhere in the chain would have brought his attention to this.  It is too whopping big for the president not to be told, and there are in pe‚Ä¶See More. Of course he knew but just doesn't care for anyone but himself. Blood on tRump's hands and he should be in prison.. Shame on all the cowardly republicans allowing Trump to sell out the U.S. to Russia üò° How dare they call themselves Americans !. The fear of Putin and greed of his payment is far larger than his feelings for Americans.. I ALMOST DID NOT CLICK ON THIS VBECAUSE I KNEW THE ANSWER, YES HE DID KNOW AND HE IS HAVING POMPEO MEET WITH THE RUSSIANS TRUMP HAD IN THE OVAL OFFICE AFTER THE ELECTION FOLKS JUST DAYS AFTER HE HAD THESE MURDEROUS RUSSIANS IN OUR OVAL OFFICE, WELL YOU KNOW MELANIA AND HER FAMILY ARE COMMUNISTS SO I GUESS RTHEY MAY HAVE COME TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS COMMUISTS WIFE.. I flat out say this bullshit. Everyone around him knew about it. He was afraid to bring it up to Putin. What a joke. Of course he knows.  The question is what did he get for keeping quiet????. He‚Äôs participating with Putin in the murdering of American soldiers.. We also know that Putin has something dangerously threatening (quite likely treasonous), hanging over Donnie's head, which is why he's so kiss-butt to everything Russian.. We know, for sure, that Trump knew over a month ago. That‚Äôs when he denied knowing sooner. Over a month, and he still has not criticized Russia/Putin for doing it, nor has he come up with a plan to stop it. Despicable!!!. So the so called patriots for Trump don't care. That says a lot about them as well. Shouldn't traitors be subject to death?. How do military veterans support this excuse of a human being???. Why isn't  that enough  for people to vote against  this traitor. The question that both Democrats and Republicans should be asking Trump is ‚Äúnow that you do know (even though there‚Äôs proof he did indeed know), what are you going to do about it?‚Äù ü¶ó ü¶ó.. Of course he knew, Barr said they talked about it!. He sold his soul to Putin to cover his debts. Plus, do you really think he reads his briefings binder?. He knew and did nothing about it. He is afraid of Putin and won't confront him about anything.. He needs to be hounded into an early grave.. If you people who believe this is true and  do nothing  your are guilty as Trump. Well well....he signed policy decisions and then has said...‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know anything about it‚Äùü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò°. Please vote Blue ,please vote Blue, try to save our country.. The full headline:Former State Department Officer Said He Knows From Experience That ‚ÄúThere Is No Way Trump Could Not Have Known‚Äù About Russian Bounties: ‚ÄúHe Knew ‚Äî And He Chose To Do Nothing‚Äù. He knows and denies and does nothing about almost everything.... Putin owns Donald. The Steele dossier is all true.. And so does Moscow Mitch!!!!!. Russia has too much on him.  He's not going to go against Putin. Traitor in the WH.  Military should vote blue if they want to save their lives.. In 1980, the US military knew that President Carter was a pacifist  and wouldn't launch a retaliatory strike if the Soviets attacked.   They just hoped the Soviets wouldn't find out..

So true.,"trumputin is openly admitting to VOTER SUPPRESSION, and OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, and his repubes sit there with their nose up his ass ! ! !. Charles Pingel well said. .....OK COMRADE CHARLES!. Voter Suppression is the handlers of #45‚Äôs strategy to deflect our fear and concerns about his poor handling of the raging Covid pandemic ‚ÄòIt is what it is‚Äô #45‚Äôs response to Covid‚ò†Ô∏èWhen #45 attacks anything in a massive way, it‚Äôs always a ‚Äòsmoke & mirrors‚Äô deflection from a truth, this one being 170,000 deaths in the US as of today from the pandemic‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ÄòIt is What it is‚Äô. ABSOLUTELY  TRUE...WHILE THOUSANDS  OF AMERICANS  ARE DYING..ABSOLUTELY  CRIMINAL  BEHAVIOR... He is a disgrace to America !!! Taking over everything around us    No good Dictator!!!. Makes sense given he has no compassion or empathy for others while at the same time knowing probably prison time is waiting for him.. Jim Wazelle they provided the required ID when they registered. Getting a ‚Äúproper‚Äù Id today is not always easy, or possible, for many. Poor people can‚Äôt afford all the fees involved, and in some cases, outright impossible due to regulations that were i‚Ä¶See More. For Trump the Coronavirus, the permanent damage it causes or the deaths are just collateral damage.  I don't believe he cares at all.. Yes, he does not want people to vote. Smaller the number of people vote, he thinks better for him.. Trumptwat is destroying our democracy.  Only he would be so self serving and evil to destroy the post office for his own self interest.. The house the senate the federal courts the us barr the supreme court does nothing while trump continues to destroy America, what a shame!. He needs to be tried for treason when he leave office, just like the Nuremberg trials or Saddam Hussein for trying to strip our country of democracy and walking all over the Constitution!. Isn't that the horrible truth??!. Absolutely üíØ He doesn't care about any of us... Trump  has infringed  more  on  the second  amendment  than  Obama  ever  did  and  now  he‚Äôs  done  it  to  the  first  amendment  with  the  attacks  on  peaceful  protesters.  Now he‚Äôs  flat  out  attacking  democracy  by  trying to  deny  the  right  to  vote  or  the  ability of  millions of  Americans  to  cast  their  votes.. It is amazing to me how so many righteous people support Trump and his lying, cheating , felonious and misogynistic behavior?. Suppressing the vote has forever been a Republican tactic, but Trump has made it a slap in the face with the Post Office obliteration.. He is hoping the virus will keep people from going to the polls to vote. By stopping the mail-in vote he thinks he will win the election rigged once again. And you are more concerned about politics and should be back in your HOME town helping with all of its problems. Very true.  What gets me is he is either arrogant or stupid for revealing his plan.. Indeed! After all he is only doing what he is capable of doing that is NOTHING!. YES YOU ARE THE  ABSOLUTE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  DONNIE BOY. More people vote less chance of Donald president of Death winning. tRUMP is so stupid, maybe someone in his inner circle should have warn him that even if he won the election fair n square more then half of the population won't  believe it, and then things could become explosive in the usa. Yes he will be glad to serve second term in life prision. Why?  Because he was Black?  You are beyond oblivious to what is going on now and who is leading it.. I agree with you Bob. Now he trying everything he can do is to steal the election. The man is dishonest.. Donald's brother died two days ago. Donald say a thing until we exploded about USPS. He's trying to play the pity card.. Anyone who supports this baboon is a traitor just like trump,. So true, how come no one interferes? This shows once again none of the GOP, besides Mitt Romney, has a backbone and afraid of this traitor. I think it's the Democrats that are trying to rig things.. Ron is right - and DT is already trying to set up the argument that the election was rigged & so he can have a case to try to void it...Trump will be out ‚Äúby a landslide‚Äù but will try anything to keep the Presidency - brace up Americans, Trump‚Äôs most blatant ‚Äòscoffing of the law‚Äô could be just around the corner.... Dam right. He all over suppressing the vote but the Corona virus that will magically go away.. 100 times better than the POS in office right now.. Trump has failed like most of his adventures in business will you can mark this one as will. Failed. Or buildings or statues!! Both more important than American lives!!. So what is being done about it?. Obama went down in history as one of the best pres ever! Trump is the worst!Can't change history!. Obummer was the absolute worst thing to ever happen!.  ....HUSSAIN...You Get To STFU!!!.

This speaks for itself.,"My point exactly - this crime was a drug related personal revenge killing - hello geniuses. Why not take a friendly, happy dog as company and some happy chat ... HUH. And there are still more of them that have killed people and have not been charged, remember the young woman sleeping in her bed and they broke in in the middle of the night killed her, the guy they were after had already been picked up and was in custody plus he lived on the other side of town that's one reason they are still protesting. I guess we could protest that a man with prior felonies and two pending drug related charges had a gun in the first place. :(. They guy wasn‚Äôt collecting a taxpayer salary either, nor was his job to ‚Äúprotect and serve.‚Äù. Protest that a gun was used to kill him.. Pretty spot on that the dog is smarter than the maga. Put the shoe on the other foot and the same thing can be said about the Police Officer who killed George Floyd.  Protests, rioting, looting, and destruction of public and private property all continue.. They just don't know what they don't know.. But they will push the same narrative tomorrow. What about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about, what about ......... Now there is something I haven't tried yet. Talking to Republican Trump supporters has proven to be an exercise in futility. I haven't tried to use a dog to do the talking however.. What are you trying to do, make them think and not hate?. Duh.... Hmmm the cops were also arrested and charged but the protests and destruction of property still goes on.. Iuzuny Garcia. yep. Erich Schlegel. now do that with george floyd. the racist act like this boys killer was fed BK drivethru on way to police station like that guy who killed many in that church mas killing.. Prexactly.. The bigger issue with this boy being shot and killed is why do the mentally ill have such easy access to guns.. https://www.mediamatters.org/.../list-right-wing.... Protesting is pointless and irrelevant. It serves no purpose except to further the racial divide instead of everyone trying to get along and work towards a common goal. And as sad as it is to say there are countless people, both blacks and whites, that don‚Äôt really want change. They just to bitch and complain. They believe that the world should only revolve around them. And THAT‚ÄôS why change will never happen. Maybe we should be protesting the idiots who decided another idiot with a gun was a good thing.. If anyone clicks on the justice for cannon link this is what it says It took three months, a brutal video being leaked, and massive national uproar for the Ahmaud Arbery case to go viral. It took 74 days for the murderers to be arrested. It took a mo‚Ä¶See More. Protest against BLM being a hate group. Duh.

Trump is going to hate this.,"I LOVE THIS GUY. He's EXACTLY what America need to TAKE this Country BACK from the TRAITORS IN CONGRESS. Get ALL those Republicans OUT.. Postal workers should donate some time to count votes and make sure ballots are delivered.To save their job from this tyrant. God help us if he is reelected.. trump is taking money out of the postal workers pockets to try to protect him to be re-elected!  It is sad that some Americans cannot see or want to see through his con!  It effects everyone and not just democrats!. Yes Union Strong. Support your postal workers Everyone get out and Vote Blue for Biden and Harris. okay so what say us former postal employees volunteer to count votes just for this election.. That would be GREAT,I'm sure my wife would agree,before Cheetos man fks up and steals all your retirement money,and INSURANCE. There you go a simple way to make the man in the WH go cuckoo. Next is the Republicans in the senate who block the stimulus bill let them go down in defeat this November. As of the house maintain the status quo but get rid of Congressional Republican terrorists.. Its on hold supposedly till after the election. Terrible. I made the call to the senators . Callüìû‚òéÔ∏è. Many years ago during a mail strike in New York the National Guard was called out to sort the mail!  Is it the Governors who get to call them up? If so let them call up the guard to sort and count the votes!. Joe biden's incapable of being president, the Democrats won him in there so that they can tell him what to do, and then get rid of him.. Thank you Postal Workers! Vote early! Vote blue!!. I still say he only cares about HIMSELF ,greed is a ugly thing to have .. post office been open for a lot of years took baby hurt 3 years to file bankruptcy. Sounds like a plan but you can‚Äôt count what hasn‚Äôt been delivered because of no overtime or whatever.. Maybe this is a thank you trump, the last straw üòâ. The union also did not fail to note the postmaster general‚Äôs conflicts of interest and efforts to ‚Äúkneecap‚Äù the postal system, as President Obama referred to them. The Trump administration‚Äôs naked power grab will not go unnoticed by voters in November, either. From the article.. Doesn't the new head of the Postal Service have investments in other mail delivery companies?. Fauci says we can vote in person. Vote üó≥ Blue is the right thing to Do !. How about.  FedEx. They work too. They need help. I think it's great but its just going to piss off Trump more. He is a S##T show!!. Don‚Äôt piss off union workers!. He will turn on them. I can‚Äôt believe Trump is now removing post boxes in Montana. But Trump and his wife voted by mail in ballots last week. God I despise that man. People are pissed. He‚Äôs gotta go.. Oops Henry ended up blocked.....  How did that happen?. Great!. All unions should vote democrat, the only union trump cares about is the police union and that‚Äôs only because he backs the bad people in their union. Maybe they should look at themselves why trump backs them. Get movin joe. 2 1/2 months  how many more institutions will he try to destroy?. Buy stamps!. I guess that he'll just fire them all on Monday.. Go for it get trumps ass the hell out of the W H. Looks like the pressure got to the USPS. They put out a statement tonight........‚ÄúWe are suspending the removal of collection boxes at this time. All postings on collection boxes will be removed, as we will no longer be pulling any boxes. ‚Äú. So why do the Republican politicians let this go on? Because they ALL get a piece of the action. They ALL get Republican funds from Russia or other corrupt world organizations, funneled through the NRA and other corrupt donors. If they say something, they lose any s‚Ä¶See More. Do people actually think that just because the union backs Biden that all postal workers are going to vote for him if so I have a bridge and a island I want to sale. So a Union is forcing 300k people to vote one way?. There are a lot of postal workers. lmao. Election altering my ass. That was the same war cry teachers made in Texas during the last election..

tyrant god help us if he is reelected trump is taking money out of the postal workers pockets to try to protect him to be re elected it is sad that some americans cannot see or want to see through his con it effects everyone and not just democrats yes union strong support your postal workers everyone get out and vote blue for biden and harris okay so what say us former postal employees volunteer to count votes just for this election that would be great i am sure my wife would agree before cheetos man fks up and steals all your retirement money and insurance there you go a simple way to make the man in the wh go cuckoo next is the republicans in the senate who block the stimulus bill let them go down in defeat this november as of the house maintain the status quo but get rid of congressional republican terrorists its on hold supposedly till after the election terrible i made the call to the senators call many years ago during a mail strike in new york the national guard was called out to sort the mail is it the governors who get to call them up if so let them call up the guard to sort and count the votes joe bidens incapable of being president the democrats won him in there so that they can tell him what to do and then get rid of him thank you postal workers vote early vote blue i still say he only cares about himself greed is a ugly thing to have post office been open for a lot of years took baby hurt 3 years to file bankruptcy sounds like a plan but you cannot count what has not been delivered because of no overtime or whatever maybe this is a thank you trump the last straw the union also did not fail to note the postmaster generals conflicts of interest and efforts to kneecap the postal system as president obama referred to them the trump administrations naked power grab will not go unnoticed by voters in november either from the article does not the new head of the postal service have investments in other mail delivery companies fauci says we can vote in person vote blue is the right thing to do how about fedex they work too they need help i think it is great but its just going to piss off trump more he is a s t show do not piss off union workers he will turn on them i cannot believe trump is now removing post boxes in montana but trump and his wife voted by mail in ballots last week god i despise that man people are pissed he is gotta go oops henry ended up blocked how did that happen great all unions should vote democrat the only union trump cares about is the police union and that is only because he backs the bad people in their union maybe they should look at themselves why trump backs them get movin joe 2 1 2 months how many more institutions will he try to destroy buy stamps i guess that he will just fire them all on monday go for it get trumps ass the hell out of the w h looks like the pressure got to the usps they put out a statement tonight we are suspending the removal of collection boxes at this time all postings on collection boxes will be removed as we will no longer be pulling any boxes so why do the republican politicians let this go on because they all get a piece of the action they all get republican funds from russia or other corrupt world organizations funneled through the nra and other corrupt donors if they say something they lose any do people actually think that just because the union backs biden that all postal workers are going to vote for him if so i have a bridge and a island i want to sale so a union is forcing 300k people to vote one way there are a lot of postal workers lmao election

Omg this is brilliant ~Baz the Timelord,"Love to imagine american politics as movies based on Shakespearean tragedies, which always have good endings for everyone involved.

Sometimes you just want to crumble at the thought of how much hate exists in the world. Sometimes poetry is the best way to revive that connection to the human experience. Here's Warsan Shire's poem ""Home."" no one leaves home unless... home is the mouth of a shark you only run for the border when you see the whole city running as well your neighbors running faster than you breath bloody in their throats the boy you went to school with who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory is holding a gun bigger than his body you only leave home when home won‚Äôt let you stay. no one leaves home unless home chases you fire under feet hot blood in your belly it‚Äôs not something you ever thought of doing until the blade burnt threats into your neck and even then you carried the anthem under your breath only tearing up your passport in an airport toilet sobbing as each mouthful of paper made it clear that you wouldn‚Äôt be going back. you have to understand, that no one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land no one burns their palms under trains beneath carriages no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled means something more than journey. no one crawls under fences no one wants to be beaten pitied no one chooses refugee camps or strip searches where your body is left aching or prison, because prison is safer than a city of fire and one prison guard in the night is better than a truckload of men who look like your father no one could take it no one could stomach it no one skin would be tough enough the go home blacks refugees dirty immigrants asylum seekers sucking our country dry niggers with their hands out they smell strange savage messed up their country and now they want to mess ours up how do the words the dirty looks roll off your backs maybe because the blow is softer than a limb torn off or the words are more tender than fourteen men between your legs or the insults are easier to swallow than rubble than bone than your child‚Äôs body in pieces. i want to go home, but home is the mouth of a shark home is the barrel of the gun and no one would leave home unless home chased you to the shore unless home told you to quicken your legs leave your clothes behind crawl through the desert wade through the oceans drown save be hunger beg forget pride your survival is more important no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear saying ‚Äî leave, run away from me now i dont know what i‚Äôve become but i know that anywhere is safer than here","For those looking to do something, anything, to help, Advocates Abroad has been on the ground helping refugees in Greece for years now..

"Grammatical Genders in different languages of different regions of India Grammatical gender technically means a specific form of noun class system in which the ...division of noun classes forms an agreement system with another aspect of the language, such as adjectives, articles, pronouns, or verbs. We see that in North Indian languages like Hindi and Punjabi - all entities in the world are categorized as either masculine or feminine. Assamese, like Malayalam, has gendered pronouns. Languages like Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada have three categories like Sanskrit for masculine, feminine and neuter genders. Tamil has a unique concept of Thinai where entities are categorized as Uyarthinai and Ahrinai - (Rational and Irrational). Humans, Gods and Demons are Uyarthinai and rest everything is in Ahrinai. The first category has gender associated with it. The second category can be further classified as animate and inanimate (living and non-living) which have further specific word usage. Malayalam, the youngest Dravidian language has no gender in the verbs, however there are gendered pronouns. Telugu is interesting because technically it has the three genders, but in practical usage, there are 2 - masculine and non-masculine. Bengali, Odia, Assamese and most NE languages except for Khasi have no grammatical genders. Mundari languages do not have masculine and feminine differentiation (which is changing due to interaction to other gendered languages) but have a human-nonhuman gender difference.

Why go through the trouble of intercontinental labor migration when a regional one could suffice? The answer is not indentured laborers' greater productivity. Most planters were convinced that their indentured Indian laborers were less productive than the Africans they supplanted. Nor was indentured labor necessarily cheaper once the considerable recruitment costs were taken into consideration. The key factor may have been that the terms of the indentured contract allowed for much greater control of the labor force. - David Northrup,Duh.

Amidst a wave of strikes of mostly male transport and dockworkers across Britain, a group of mostly non-union women and girls working in factories walked out and began parading through the streets, calling on other workers to join them. Custard, jam, biscuit, tool and tent-making factories were among those shut down, with around 14,000 women from ov...er 20 different employers on strike within a few days. Employers complained of a ""reign of terror"" by the workers, and the government responded by ordering troops to be stationed in nearby Southwark Park. The strikers got assistance from the National Federation of Women Workers, who raised money and helped the women formulate concrete demands to make of employers. Companies rapidly began to cave in, abolishing piecework and increasing pay in most of the struck enterprises over the next month. While many male unionists had dismissed women workers, like Labour MP and union leader Will Thorne who claimed that women ""do not make good trade unionists"", thousands of women joined unions during the dispute and organised themselves. * We have lots of interesting anniversaries today: for all of them follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/wrkclasshistory","It could be done today, but so many have become brain-washed by the media..

"Capitalism is Ecocide #LearnSocialism Image description: Capitalism is Ecocide [Pictogram: A capitalism monster--a factory building with tentacles--sinks its teeth into the Earth, while its tentacles rip trees and animals from the ground. Plastic waste, dead fish, and dead whale float in the ocean. A gray cloud spews from the monster and envelopes the Earth in toxic fumes. A variety of insects fall from the face of the Earth and lay dead below it.] Ecocide is large-scale damage to, destruction of, or loss of ecosystems, most often used to refer to the humanity's destructive impact on the natural environment. Life on Earth is being wiped out by human activity, and not just any activity, but a historically specific activity called *capitalist production*, which views all of nature as raw material to be ripped from the Earth and transformed into profits, and nature's habitats as its productive facilities and waste bins for the garbage and toxic byproducts of its productive processes.","There can be no ethical consumption under capitalism.

"While working on updating our Learn Socialism Collection today, we made some edits to this graphic for clarity. Hopefully it's more clear than the previous version. #LearnSocialism Image description: The Purchase of People Under capitalism, capitalists purchase amounts of labor from wage-workers. The amount of labor purchased is measured in units of time, usually by the hour. When labor is purchased in units of time, it becomes a special commodity (a good or service) called labor-power. This exchange between capitalists (employers) and wage-workers (employees) creates an illusion: that a worker is even capable of selling their labor or their time separate from themselves in the first place. Hidden behind this illusion is a truth: that a person's labor and time are, in reality, inseparable from their person. [Pictogram: A triangle, with a person at the top corner, a hand holding a wrench (representing labor) at the bottom right corner, and a hand holding a clock (representing time) at the bottom left corner.] This means that with the sale of human labor-power comes the purchase of not only people's labor and time, but also of people. The basic difference between the slave and the wage-worker is this: the slave is sold by another all at once and as a whole, while the wage-worker must sell themselves to one capitalist or another, again and again, hour by hour, piece by piece.","+- 12 hours somewhere. +- 12 hours somewhere.

"Our Lives Are Essential, Capitalism Is Not As the number of infected and deceased increases during this pandemic, we, the working class, continue to pay for the consequences of Capitalism, its ambition and maliciousness. Many governments have refused to enact total quarantines, and those who have, have established all sorts of tricks to ensure the normal functioning of trade and production, forcing us to risk dying from COVID-19, whether through work or hunger, without income... or economic protection to face this crisis and provide for our families. Likewise, we have witnessed the epic image that has been built around health workers, who are really risking their lives to save others, without adequate protection, sufficient personnel, and the equipment necessary to truly combat the pandemic. What they call heroism is precarity; appealing to heroic applause for those who should be able to serve safely. With horror we see how the police and repressive forces that circulate through the streets implementing control over people have these security elements financed by public spending. In other words, the priority is repression and control of the population, instead of taking care of and providing the essentials for life. The working class has to participate in decision-making about this crisis, about who will pay for it, about what measures will be taken in the territories to deal with it, we cannot simply be spectators at this juncture. In turn, the call is to take care of ourselves, to unite in these times of estrangement, to express more solidarity and not let go. Only solidarity and mutual aid will allow us to resist.

It‚Äôs 2020 but some people are mad over women talking about their sexuality.,"Pretty sure Ben Shapiro is a hamster that was cursed by a witch with a human form for wanting to tell everyone what to do.. John Garlick. I'm mad that its bad. Bring back Missy Elliot.. That's all I can think it is. You would suppose Ben Shapiro would be so happy. The song glorifies rich men, alpha males and chads like an incel forum turned into a chart-topping hit. It has to be that women aren't allowed to talk about sex, because otherwise they should really love this song.. I think the song sucks but that‚Äôs just one person‚Äôs opinion. Women should do whatever the fuck they want. Call me old but I remember when conservatives were outraged at Salt-N-Pepa for owning their sexuality . I'm pretty sick and tired of people being shocked or digusted by women's expression and power over their sexuality. Some men brag about wanting nasty sex and having wet dreams with wild fantasies, but get triggered at the fact that women are or can be kinky too üò¨.. Didn't Salt n' Peppa make a song/video about the exact same thing 25 years ago? And society still can't handle it? That's some serious snowflakeism.. What bothers me isn't the song, it's nice, it's the discussion surrounding it. Obviously annoying are the Ben Shapiros, but I don't expect anything else from them honestly, so what bothers me quite more is alot of people claiming this would be empoweri‚Ä¶See More. Ben Shapiro is mad at women for existing. Kudos, ladies!. She's a talentless hack and her ""music"" is complete shit. Same idiots wank over songs by eminem or necro about chopping women up but this is just too much man. Theres literally a movie about a guy fucking a pie and America loved it. So is Cardi B suddenly.not canceled anymore lol. Lilli Moralis. ""his wife, who is a doctor, told him that a vagina so wet it requires a ""bucket and a mop"" [...] might be a sign of a sexually transmitted infection""Anyone else get the feeling that Ben's wife is protecting him from the truth about why he's never seen a WAP?. Imagine telling the whole world that your wiener is so small and skinny it can comfortably fit into a dry vagina.....üíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Dry ass Ben bucket and mop posting. Porn.

sex worker what the fuck is up with this comment section where did all the bootlickers come from there are good and bad in everyone just wish there were more good then build your own shelter why are not all of you buying and building homes and opening them up free to people who need them wants government to force land owners to house them calls you bootlicker if you disagree lol pathetic meme

people you want here cristian avalos we are not able to get to everything right away but we had a fun time dropping the ban hammer on these folks so you guys are gonna buy your own houses that landlord worked hard to get that house and you want to evict him on his own property that is theft into the bin i see the poors are at it again lmaooo going and taking someone elses land for free because you think you are entitled to it i thought we were against colonizers tom wanting to take away private property thereby forcing everyone to live in free government housing is the ultimate bootlicker ideology where did all the alt right ancap trolls come from our current system of poverty pimping is the most expensive way to provide beds for the homeless and we still have thousands in every state with no place to lay their head at night it would be far cheaper to buy up the reo stock and give the homes to the homeless you clowns are parasites wanting free room and board the people that think like this are probably the same ones that waste their money on weed and tacobell at 2 am a bunch of cookie cutter people in the comments that cannot figure out that most people encounter significant barriers to just buy a house or they do not care but either way they have not figured out that we are ready to fight them for it and win legalize squatting again we have hosted homeless refugees the council did not provide housing for in spite of all the taxes they take if private landlords or home owners would not step in more people would be out in the street or unable to keep up

about 1 of the people who do realistically and i am just saying it is not necessary for most of us and it is not cheap most people do not use only a 20 year old rifle and some bullets that is just not the truth of hunting culture ava adamsi agree that those who have the space and the means are extremely well served by gardening but that could take hours and hours week after week to come to fruition lulu barbarossa you think killing a wild animal for food is more cruel than raising hogs and steer in crowded conditions sometimes where their feet never touch the ground where they are shot full of chemicals that affect whoever eats them etc lulu barbarossa inuit and other native peoples my sister is half choctaw and grew up on the nez perce reservation if they did not hunt or fish they would starve but you are stupid so you do not care typical millennial hypster daniel newman 308 round cost more than 50 what happens when all the trucks stop delivering food and the stores shut down hunting can be done when there is no food to be bought also wildcrafting for food is another good option when food can not be bought neil tredray but the radical left do not want cow farts let alone the human farts with all of these beans methane you know i do not know the statistics of who hunts on a socio economic basis but given how expensive hunting equipment is poorer folks who hunt are likely to have passed down said equipment borrowed from friends etc i have several uncles who hunt one of lulu barbarossa we harvested our moose last year less than a kilometer from the front door it cost next to nothing to fill multiple freezers with the meat from 1 animal lulu barbarossa if you think the pandemic started in a meat market you stopped reading science about it in april and trust me we all know

"Concentration of production (i.e. moving from from many small enterprises to a handful of monopolies) is a process inherent to capitalism. When monopolies have eliminated competition inside the borders in which they operate, they begin looking abroad for new resources to extract and new labor to exploit.

"Just so we're all clear -- this is what an assault weapons ban looks like. It would take every bit of political capital the Democrats have built over the last three years, and the only real-world effect would be that you can buy the gun on top, but not the gun below. The basic function of a rifle -- sending a bullet out of a barrel -- is what makes it deadly. Any legislation restricting the features on a rifle will lead to the production of loophole guns that are equally powe...rful but manage to avoid the ""assault weapon"" category. This isn't even getting into the fact that there are *at least* 5-10 million fully-featured AR-15s already in circulation in the United States. So even if a ban were to pass, it would be functionally irrelevant. Image Description: An image displaying two AR-15 platform rifles that are almost exactly the same, save for three small differences. One rifle is labeled ‚ÄúNot an Assault Rifle At All‚Äù, the other is labeled ‚ÄúDefinitely an Assault Rifle‚Äù. At the bottom, an SRA logo and text that reads: ‚ÄúThe Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 did not reduce the availability of rifles in the US, nor did it make them any less lethal. In function, the law created an environment where manufacturers produced the same firearms with slightly different features, while artificially inflating the value of pre-ban models.‚Äù","One slight problem. There is a difference between assault rifles and assault weapons. An assault rifle is a select fire shoulder weapon chambered in an intermediate cartridge and was already regulated by the NFA as a machine gun before they were even invented. An assault weapon is whatever the fuck liberals in New York and California want to call it in order to make sure citizens can't have good guns.. Putting your focus on arguing semantics vs broadly accepted nomenclature is not going to help anything,. Randall Munro broadly accepted doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs correct.. Randall Munro except that's not semantics. that's literal legal definition of an assualt rifle. and assualt weapon can literally be anything someone deems scarey. theres no legal definition for it at all. Being incorrect on legal technicalities doesn't help our image much either. Don't act like no reactionary will ever see it, pick it apart, and tell everyone we don't know what we're doing. An assault rifle has an automatic selector switch. It is already banned. That an overlooked technicality here üòÜ. Marie Cassandra Tristani Trust me you guys are already way ahead of all the people on the pseudo-socialists page(Democratic socialists) lol that place is a fucking joke.. Assault rifles aren't a real thing. Assault rifle is a select fire (implying modes other then semi auto such as full or burst fire) chambered in an intermediate cartridge.  A semi auto rifle is a semi auto rifle no matter if the barrel is threaded, or if there is a bayonet lug or if the magazine is large or small.End of.. Support the 2nd amendment, but remember support single action long guns not semi auto long guns. Support bolt action, lever action, and pump action long guns. Do not support semi automatic long guns.. Guys. Imagine literally being an incel.. Peter Raymond oh is that why we're a supreme force unopposed in Afghanistan?.

Peter Raymond The same US military who has been bogged down in the ME for the past twenty years fighting insurgent groups with basically nothing but small arms?Asymmetrical Warfare is legitimate.. Remember when the US fought an 18 year war against goat herders. Important history time.Did you know the IRA averaged only 250 rounds of spent ammunition and 40 pounds spent explosive ordnance yearly during the 30 years prior to the Good Friday agreement.‚Ä¶See More. Peter RaymondCheck out a podcast called It Could Happen Here. There's an episode detailing how a rebellion could succeed in America.. Peter Raymond your ego is showing bud. You are obviously not familiar with military tactics or revolutionary action. Your argument is valid and has been noted, but history does not align with what you are saying. Revolutionary actions take time and build up from grassroot action.. bruh.... Peter keeps calling everyone morons which is incredibly ironic.. Imagine thinking the 2nd Amendment was about hunting. Lol. You know what the only distance between a semiautomatic rifle and a pistol is? Effective range and rifles require two hands to shoot and can't be concealed. That's it. Both are equally deadly. Just because you are afraid of the word semiautomatic doesn't mean it's an assault weapon. Pistols are semiautomatic too. Are you gonna ban them too?. Jonathan McCowan the IRA brought no-one to a standstill, the (now threatened due to Brexit!) Good Friday Agreement happened because enough ordinary people from both sides of the divide & the political orgs had seen enough bloodshed from terrorists & the sometimes murderous British army. They didn‚Äôt win peace through violence, despite the idiotic funding from Irish Americans in the previous decades.. I read that the US military forces amount to roughly 1.250.000 people.. Bruce Andrew Hansen support the 1st amendment.  But remember only support non-auto refill pens or electronic communications.  Support quill and ink on paper only.  Do not support widespread automatic communications.. Broose Andrew Hansen I don‚Äôt believe the 2cnd amendment has any type of wording banning any type of weapon ... sorry. Peter, that‚Äôs an argument for citizens to have more strong and powerful weapons, not less of them.  I do believe the government would bomb its own people but if they plan on winning, they‚Äôll still need the infrastructure to maintain some semblance of sanity among those that didn‚Äôt rise up..

The solution isn't to ban the WEAPONS, but the CALIBRES - the 5.56x45mm bullet is a military cartridge that has no function in either home defense or hunting, designed to be lightweight enough to allow fully automatic fire but still lethal - hell, one ‚Ä¶See More. These comments litteraly gave men an aneurism,. Wasn't it Reagan that started the assault rifle ban and was against civilians having ar-15 type weapons?. Not that it matters to the wealthy;as long as you've got the money and a ""clean""record you can get the tax stamp for any Firearm.I know guys w/fully automatic MP-5s!Our firearms laws need overhaul from stem to stern starting w/Firearms  safety education being mandatory in schools!. Ahhh , so if I‚Äôm shot and notice no bayonet lug I can relax knowing how much worse my bleeding would be if it was an assault rifle. Pointing this out may just lead to Canada style bans. It's frustrating.. Seems a firearms class would really help lawmakers. Showing ballistics of rounds, teaching capabilities, range time with shotguns (auto, snub, over under, standard), subs, rifles, long guns, rimfire/center fire/wheel pistols, and then show them Jerry M‚Ä¶See More. I can't tell if this is satire. All of the essential things that make an assault rifle are maintained. I'm not saying I disagree with the premise but you can't tell me there is a fundemental difference between an M16 and an AR15. Now we are getting somewhere.. While we are literally filling concentration camps seems an incredibly odd time to pass any sort of gun control legislation.. What‚Äôs the functionality difference between a threaded and non threaded barrel?. Ain‚Äôt it grand how current talk is focused on Armalite and Kalashnikov, but no mention of the other major companies that produce far better job security for the undertaker.Take Barrett Arms. Even though it‚Äôs a 50 cal, Anti-Material rifle producer, just about all of their weapons would not be classified as ‚ÄúAssault Weapons‚Äù under the terms above.. Amen. As long as it fires rounds at indecent rate, it's a good deterrent for would-be attackers.And hey, if you guys are after some lighthearted good fun, MAAAAYBE come like this page. Its run by some lefties and it's 100% worker friendly ;)‚Ä¶See More. This is why I favor applying the Machine Gun Act approach to everything that can hold more than 6 rounds. The MA has been around for many decades, and collectors/reenactors  can still get a BAR or something if they want, but nobody's been getting killed with them.. Dont ban the gun then, ban the ammunition. Make it so you can only buy ammunition at licensed target ranges, and you're not allowed to take the ammunition home.. Any weapon not capable of selective fire is ipso facto NOT an assault rifle lacking one of the defining features of the category.. Don't forget the pistol grip makes it a lot more deadly, if you live in NY.. Bayonets are pretty cool though. I like spears. Spears are good.. i did not know this before i saw this.thanks for the educationü§ôüèª. Naw, I don‚Äôt agree with this. Large capacity magazine bans definitely save lives.. Expect AWB 2.0 to just ban semi-automatic rifles.And expect the next evolution of the AR pattern to allow you to cock it with your thumb or something like that.... This is what a legal AR-15 looks like with an ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù ban.  Still shoots the same, just less comfortable to hold.. No such thing, Full Auto, semi-auto or single fire. The suppressor ban has somehow kept mass shooters loud though.. here you go Kevin Gilbert, these are the types I associate with. You forget the 3 round burst to fully auto. They wanna ban both. And confiscate all that are already out there.. Eric Knabe. Austin Rose. I'll take my 12ga with a 3.5"" in buck over these toys any day. This all assumes they'd call an assault rifle the same thing as the old ban.That said. I really don't see any particular weapon ban working when almost any other kind of firearm would be just as effective.‚Ä¶See More. That‚Äôs not true you can limit it to just single action rifles and not 30 round clips. Combat rifles like ARs aren‚Äôt the same as simple hunting rifles.. Roberto Acquafredda.. Also, pick up your shit while you still can.  Extended mag bans almost always come first. When did all these gun grabbers start following this page? If it's such an issue to you then move to freaking Canada... Where owning a firearm IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.Don't try to abolish that right here just because you think it's acceptable fo‚Ä¶See More. Fixed this for you.. So my rifle will be worth more money?  Thanks dumbocrats!. The majority of the population supports banning them.  Left slanted polling shows about 75%, the recent polling from Fox News, obviously right slanted, shows 66% in favor of a new, permanent AWB.. I sort of assume but does anyone know if the 3% who own half of all guns (8 or more each person) are mostly or all white supremacists?. Forgets selective fire is the main definition of an assault rifle. 2019 assault weapons ban bill.https://www.congress.gov/.../116th.../senate-bill/66/text. Chris Brian Swientek confirm?. It's an assault weapon,  built for 1 thing only. Kill lots of people very quickly. The only difference between the civilian and military M16 is the switch to full automatic.  It's like letting anyone drive a semi truck or passenger bus without training.. Dead schoolchildren the price we pay so some smalldicked boy can prance around playing scary army man enlist u pussy oh yea that shoot back pussys. The AWB did little but drive innovation in the firearms market.  Here's an example: the Olympic OA96https://www.full30.com/.../olympic-oa96-pistol-a-loophole....

intermediate cartridge and was already regulated by the nfa as a machine gun before they were even invented an assault weapon is whatever the fuck liberals in new york and california want to call it in order to make sure citizens cannot have good guns putting your focus on arguing semantics vs broadly accepted nomenclature is not going to help anything randall munro broadly accepted does not mean it is correct randall munro except that is not semantics that is literal legal definition of an assualt rifle and assualt weapon can literally be anything someone deems scarey theres no legal definition for it at all being incorrect on legal technicalities does not help our image much either do not act like no reactionary will ever see it pick it apart and tell everyone we do not know what we are doing an assault rifle has an automatic selector switch it is already banned that an overlooked technicality here marie cassandra tristani trust me you guys are already way ahead of all the people on the pseudo socialists page democratic socialists lol that place is a fucking joke assault rifles are not a real thing assault rifle is a select fire implying modes other then semi auto such as full or burst fire chambered in an intermediate cartridge a semi auto rifle is a semi auto rifle no matter if the barrel is threaded or if there is a bayonet lug or if the magazine is large or small end of support the 2nd amendment but remember support single action long guns not semi auto long guns support bolt action lever action and pump action long guns do not support semi automatic long guns guys imagine literally being an incel peter raymond oh is that why we are a supreme force unopposed in afghanistan peter raymond lmaoo at people who think not having weapons is somehow a better lol k peter raymond the same us military who has been bogged down in the me for the past twenty years fighting insurgent groups with basically nothing but small arms asymmetrical warfare is legitimate remember when the us fought an 18 year war against goat herders important history time did you know the ira averaged only 250 rounds of spent ammunition and 40 pounds spent explosive ordnance yearly during the 30 years prior to the good friday agreement peter raymondcheck out a podcast called it could happen here there is an episode detailing how a rebellion could succeed in america peter raymond your ego is showing bud you are obviously not familiar with military tactics or revolutionary action your argument is valid and has been noted but history does not align with what you are saying revolutionary actions take time and build up from grassroot action bruh peter keeps calling everyone morons which is incredibly ironic imagine thinking the 2nd amendment was about hunting lol you know what the only distance between a semiautomatic rifle and a pistol is effective range and rifles require two hands to shoot and cannot be concealed that is it both are equally deadly just because you are afraid of the word semiautomatic does not mean it is an assault weapon pistols are semiautomatic too are you gonna ban them too jonathan mccowan the ira brought no one to a standstill the now threatened due to brexit good friday agreement happened because enough ordinary people from both sides of the divide the political orgs had seen enough bloodshed from terrorists the sometimes murderous british army they did not win peace through violence despite the idiotic funding from irish americans in the previous decades i read that the us military forces amount to roughly 1 250 000 people bruce andrew hansen support the 1st amendment but remember only support non auto refill pens or electronic communications support quill and ink on paper only do not support widespread automatic communications broose andrew hansen i do not believe the 2cnd amendment has any type of wording banning any type of weapon sorry peter that is an argument for citizens to have more strong and powerful weapons not less of them i do believe the government would bomb its own people but if they plan on winning they will still need the infrastructure to maintain some semblance of sanity

"Doxxing is serious threat that we need to keep in mind as we engage in physical and online activist spaces. The most vocal organizers and content creators are more vulnerable, but the reality is that some fascists will attempt to doxx you for as little as showing up to a peaceful protest. In the past, this has lead to online harassment campaigns, workplace harassment, death threats -- and as we saw just this summer in Philadelphia -- it can even escalate to an armed far-right street gang showing up to your home to intimidate and harass you directly.

This reality illuminates the true role these agencies play; the militant arm of a violent settler-colonial project, responsible for targeting indigenous and other ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù populations as our liberal-democratic systems of governance decay into an increasingly reactionary, fa...scist form. In light of the recent news regarding plans for an ICE training facility with ‚Äúsimulations of homes in Chicago and Arizona,‚Äù that are so ‚Äúhyper-realistic‚Äù that they include details like ‚Äúdishes in the sink, toys in the yard,‚Äù it becomes clear that ICE is even further militarizing themselves to target communities at home. Rightly alarmed by these developments, more and more people have been asking how they can defend their communities from being torn apart by raids and other anti-immigrant ICE actions. One such tool is the Rapid Response Network. Rapid Response Networks can use a variety of tactics in response to ICE raids ‚Äî some send teams to provide legal council, some collect information so families‚Äô loved ones are not lost in the immigration system, some send volunteers with video equipment to film encounters. And when necessary, some will go as far as hosting targets of ICE in their very own homes. #WeKeepUsSafe Suggestions for Building a Rapid Response Network in your workplace: https://www.labornotes.org/‚Ä¶/building-rapid-response-networ‚Ä¶ Example of a Rapid Response Network organized by religious leaders in southern California: https://www.cnn.com/‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶/us/california-immigrant-safe-houses/","so a network of aiding and abetting criminals?  k..

"Fred Hampton, Deputy Chairman of the Black Panther Party, was a young revolutionary who did a better job than anyone using materialist analysis to illuminate the common source of all the varying struggles faced by different sub-sections of the working class in the United States. Namely, the inherently exploitative nature of the capitalist mode of production. While Hampton and the BPP were committed Marxists, they did not take a class reductionist point of view. They incorpora...ted race not only in their materialist analysis, but also in their praxis. In 1968, Hampton helped organize the Rainbow Coalition, a multi-racial coalition of street gangs in Chicago, united behind the understanding that racial and ethnic conflict between gangs would only keep its members entrenched in poverty. Hampton was so effective in his work of uniting the proletariat, so threatening to the existing Capitalist economic order, that the FBI decided to murder him in bed, in the middle of the night, during a no-knock raid, as he slept next to his partner. The FBI organized a death squad. And they achieve their goal. Twenty-one years old. 21. The city of Chicago and the federal government ultimately had to pay $1.85 million to families of the deceased (the largest-ever civil rights settlement at the time) because the state‚Äôs actions were so egregious.

I'd be throwing away my own life by voting for Democrats.. Bruv.  You're from Texas, you know how that'd turn out.. The hardware stores are gonna sell out of shovels and 55 gallon drums.. This is how you get a civil war >.<. I'll bet that this would never happen. If it did he'd be expelled from office real quick. He was also selling these, lol:http://hill.cm/KVH6NNz. He's a 2 to 3 percenter,  2 to 3 percent of the polls  ha. What a shame! I just lost my AR in a freak boating accident!. Why can't gun control be a non issue to dems? It would be infinitely easier to justify voting for one. Dems should take Obama's example and look for sensible ways to expand gun rights, not restrict them.. There goes his Texas votes, lol. ''If'' is doing a lot of work here.. Oh damn I seem to have misplaced my rifle. How does he plan to do this? There is no national registry on long arms, so how will they even know who has them? I wonder if he plans to vilify my favorite rifle, the SKS?. Well he wont sooo.. Definitely a Hitler like tactic....and this coming from a democrat.. As if he'll get elected.. My AK fell down a well, sorry. well i will sell mine for the low cost of $100k each.. If he thinks the fascists are violent now, wait till he tries this. There will be a bloodbath.. Good thing he isn‚Äôt even close. Glad he's not going to be president. Oh. You‚Äôre still here?. No one will ever agree on what an assault rifle even is.  I guarantee he doesn‚Äôt know.  Proposals like this will never happen.. Beta. What about running over children with your car? is that gonna be legal finally?. well lucky there are 20 other candidates to choose from lol. That totally worked in New Zealand.. Swing and a miss.. This is where I wish I would have bought 80% lowers, instead of ones that require a transfer.... Don't trust the government but want the government to be the only ones to own guns. I don't dislike Beto, but this is seriously a bad idea.. Will our representatives still applaud the workers for refusing to sell to the government? https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1143590995122171905. This is interesting. How does one reconcile their love/absolute necessity for the right to keep and bear arms and support of leftist politicians that want to strip them of those rights?Haven‚Äôt all of the Democrat candidates expressed that they plan to take action against ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù?. He can piss off.... F him, then.. This policy is simply impossible to enforce.. The government lies, steals and kills unarmed people far more often than citizens do. If anything ,we should be disarming the gov, not citizens.... For. How. Much?'Cause you gotta admit that after the government forces you to sell your guns they probably aren't going to pay people what they're worth. Which just makes it theft.. I'm not a socialist, but I enjoy visiting this page.  Serious question: given the Democrats' insane, self-defeating stance against firearms, how do you vote in national elections?

"MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ‚Äî We Need YOUR Help! The SRA is fundraising for its disaster relief operations ahead of Hurricane Dorian's landfall on the Atlantic coast. With your help last year we raised $1300 for Hurricane Florence and $3500 for Hurricane Michael. This year we're asking for $5000 for an even larger relief effort under our new SRAid banner (which will be launching independently next year as its own 501(c)(3) charity!) Your donation will be used to purchase food, water, ...blankets, first aid, diapers, menstrual products, and other essential supplies. Our Southeast Disaster Relief Coordinator will stage near Gainesville, GA along with our volunteer members. Depending on when and where the storm makes landfall we will either deliver supplies to emergency shelters before the storm hits, or venture into the affected area after the storm has passed. In either case we will try to make sure our donations are made available to vulnerable and under-served populations that may not be able to rely on FEMA or the Red Cross for assistance.

"‚Äú'I want more leftists and even just plain (democratic socialists) open to the idea that guns are not inherently evil,' Alex Tackett, the 22-year-old president of the newly formed Socialist Rifle Association (SRA), said in a recent Reddit AMA.  Founded last year, the SRA says it aims to help members of the working class effectively defend themselves and their communities. 'Defense' is defined broadly: the group‚Äôs 52 chapters around the country have organized disaster relief e...fforts and litter clean-ups along with firearm safety classes and gun range days. The group exists in part to be a leftist alternative to the NRA, which Tackett considers a 'reactionary, capitalist institution.' The organization believes marginalized groups, including people of color and LGBTQ people, should have a space where they can learn how to use firearms to defend themselves. The group‚Äôs vice president, Faye Ecklar, a transgender socialist, says that it‚Äôs about creating 'a culture in which guns are a small part of a much larger revolutionary project to build communities that don‚Äôt need to rely on the state for protection.'""","Your Socialist ideology and private gun ownership are incompatible..

"The AK-47 -- officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova -- is a gas-operated, 7.62√ó39mm rifle. Developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov rifle (or ""AK"") family. Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945. In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. Even after seven decades, the model and i...ts variants remain one of the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of its reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region, and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual, crew-served and specialized firearms. As of 2004, ""Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s"".

"Today, far right neo-fascist group The Proud Boys are traveling from all over the country to terrorize the citizens of Portland. There are a few things we can predict.  Despite public claims that they have no intention of dolling out violence on community members, the fascists have already shared all over their private profiles that this is exactly their mission. They will show up in body armor, shields, and armed with batons and other makeshift weapons. They will instigate v...iolence against local community members. And then, despite clear violent provocation from the far right, the police will side with the fascists and attack the Portland community that they supposedly defend. Tomorrow, liberal and conservative politicians and talking heads in the media will erroneously hand wring about ‚Äúviolence on both sides.‚Äù In short, we will see the utter ineffectiveness of the state‚Äôs response to the rising tide of white supremacy, and the necessity of a united, community response to fascist street organizing wherever it appears.

The gun control community would certainly try to spin this as some kind of win. ""Gun deaths have gone down!"" In reality, homicides went up... Australia... ranks higher than the United States on the United Nations Human Development Index.

"It‚Äôs important to note that this far-right terrorist killed his step-sister before he failed in his attempt to kill Muslims in their place of worship. When you contextualize this murder with the Dayton shooter who killed his brother (a trans man who had recently begun to share their gender identity with trusted friends), and also with the Isla Vista shooting in 2014 carried out by an incel, you see that there is an unmistakable thread of misogyny running through these terror ...attacks. Sometimes it emerges in the form of patriarchal, hierarchy-obsessed fascism, as is the case with this Norwegian terrorist. Other times it emerges in the form of misogynistic incel culture, as is the case with the Dayton and Isla Vista shooters. Regardless of the particular ideological bent, it‚Äôs essential that we remain as steadfast and vigilant in our fight against misogyny and transphobia, as we do in our fight against racism and xenophobia. Lives depend on it. Also big ups to Mr. Rafiq. ‚ÄúA 65-year-old man who tackled a gunman who stormed a mosque in Norway is being hailed as a hero. The attacker, who was reportedly wearing a uniform and body armour, broke through a glass door to reach the place of worship, where people were preparing to celebrate the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha. A post on an online messaging board suggested (the shooter) was a far-right extremist inspired by the Christchurch, Poway and El Paso shooters. The same man is also accused of killing his 17-year-old stepsister, whose body was found at her home. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre investigating this as an attempt at carrying out an act of terrorism,‚Äô assistant chief of police Rune Skjold told a news conference on Sunday. ‚ÄòWe have uncovered extreme right-wing attitudes.

"Paulo Freire contributed a philosophy of education which blended modern Marxist, post-Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. During his childhood and adolescence at school, Freire ended up four grades behind, and his social life revolved around playing pick-up football with other poor children, from whom he states to have learned a great deal. These experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire state...d that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: ""I didn't understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn't dumb. It wasn't lack of interest. My social condition didn't allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge"".

"‚ÄúForcibly disarming blacks in the South was among the early Ku Klux Klan‚Äôs reasons for organizing and one of its first goals. They knew what today‚Äôs well-meaning advocates of gun control do not ‚Äî that the black letter of the law is one thing and de facto power relations are quite another.  These gun control laws were passed to disarm black citizens. We might do well to keep this history in mind today when we consider how new, more restrictive gun laws will be applied. Were th...e mere dictates of positive law the panacea that mainstream progressives believe they are, the history of this country would have looked very different.  Today, gun control legislation aggravates the criminal justice crisis in the United States, having a disproportionate impact on black Americans... Some left-wing groups are beginning to understand this and respond accordingly, abandoning the irrational and baseless conventional wisdom that support of robust gun rights is somehow conservative. The Trigger Warning Queer & Trans Gun Club and the Socialist Rifle Association are just two of the growing number of politically left-wing gun clubs and affinity organizations popping up with the goal of arming and preparing vulnerable groups.  In principle, gun control is not a liberal or progressive cause, but an authoritarian, socially retrograde one that puts vulnerable groups in harm‚Äôs way.

"We offer the deepest sympathy to the families of the victims of today's white nationalist terror attack in El Paso. The shooter's alleged manifesto expressed support for the Christchurch mosque shootings, as well as a laundry list of classic white nationalist talking points. The manifesto claims the shooter targeted this location because it would be full of non-white ""soft targets."" The far right has stacked up dozens of murders in the US in the last few years alone. Why are ...these attacks not discussed as the ideologically motivated terrorism that they are? From the article: ""Twenty people were killed and 26 others were wounded after a gunman went on a rampage Saturday at a Walmart in the Texas border town of El Paso, police said. A 21-year-old man was taken into custody after police responded within six minutes to a report of an active shooter at the Cielo Vista Mall. The suspect, who was captured on surveillance video entering the Walmart, has been identified as 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, CBS News has confirmed. Sergeant Robert Gomez, a police spokesman, said the suspect was taken into custody 'without incident' and there was no longer danger to the public.   Police Chief Greg Allen referenced a document allegedly left behind by the suspect. He said the shooting may have a 'nexus' to a hate crime but declined to elaborate.""","they took a mall shooter into custody ""without incident"" are you fucking kidding me?!. They almost always do.. Too fucking true. James Peach you have to understand that the vast majority of police share the same beliefs as these shooters. they're on the same side. I'm surprised they didn't take him out for burgers and ice cream before booking him.. if they are POC they blow them up with robot bombs. James Peach because he was üë±‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But if you‚Äôre a 69 year old anarchist setting ICE vehicles on fire, they kill you, if you‚Äôre a white mass shooter targeting non-white people, cops don‚Äôt shoot at you and you don‚Äôt shoot at them - that would be friendly fire!. If it had been a brown shooter they'd have called in an air strike. James Peach the other shooter was white and he was killed by police. Stop race baiting, you racists. because he was a part of the program. They shoot unarmed people but let spree killers go for a reason..... Jack Horvat Always a white dude who uses the phrase ""race baiting."" But they never call actual racism race baiting.. Anyone else notice these chuds have stopped eating their own guns after their shooting sprees? Why would they when the cops and media treat them like victims while their ilk glorify them as heroes?. Ricky Alan Davidson this. They're glorified as heroes by the right wing. We have to understand these mass shooters and domestic terrorist keeps the power structure in place.. Sounds like they want to find out.. There's blood on Trump's small white nationalist hands. We HAVE to make our elected officials call these assholes terrorists.. Its Walmart, who doesn't carry a gun to walmart?? Google the people of Walmart. If I ever go to Walmart I make sure I have 2 extra mags ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Taken without a scratch. Probably treating him to some burger king like they did for dylan roof. Cops have to look out for their own after all. They call us snowflakes and this dude wore hearing protection during his massacre.. Anybody on the left that is in favor of disarming the working class is insane.. But yeah, go off about how Antifa are the ones we need to worry about. So this guy gets taken into custody without incident. But Eric Garner gets placed in a chokehold for not wanting to go to jail for selling cigarettes.. Why is the State trying to label AntiFa terrorists while these massacres keep happening?. The White Wing shoots up more innocent folk. I swear to god every fucking limp dick Incel piece of shit looks exactly like this.

"‚ÄúDuring the first night of the second Democratic presidential debate, the question of how to reduce gun violence emerged as one issue on which the sometimes-splintered Democratic Party speaks with as close to one voice as it can. Candidate after candidate repeated a list of proposals they would try to enact if they become president: universal background checks, a so-called assault weapons ban, restrictions on magazine capacity, and laws to prevent those with history of mental illness or domestic violence from buying guns. But researchers who study gun violence question how effective some of the Democrats' proposals would actually be if turned into law.‚Äù","Taking guns away only hurts marginalized communities and gun control laws have been inherently racist since their inception when African Americans started standing up to the clan and chasing them out their towns.

"The Trump administration and other GOP lawmakers are expanding their pool of targets, *again.*  If this moves forward -- due to the autonomous nature of antifascist tactics -- anyone protesting a right wing figure or group, anyone defending their communities from xenophobes and fascists, could be declared a criminal. It would make it easier to add activists to watch lists, easier to seek longer sentences in criminal proceedings, easier to get federal dollars to repress organi...zing. Which is the point, really. State forces align themselves with the far right even in the best of times. But as this administration and its cronies dig deeper into reaction, we can expect a ramping up of efforts to criminalize leftist organizing and community defense. From the article: ""President Donald Trump declared Saturday that he may soon try to classify Antifa ‚Å†‚Äî a loosely defined movement composed of left-wing, autonomous, militant anti-fascist groups and individuals ‚Å†‚Äî as a major terrorist organization to make it ""easier for police to do their job."" While some members of Antifa have indeed damaged property and engaged in physical violence, they have not yet been linked to any killings in America, unlike some known hate groups that have not been designated as terrorist organizations.  Right-wing extremists were responsible for 73.3 percent of the more than 425 deaths in the U.S. attributable to violent extremism between 2009 and 2018, according to an ADL report released earlier this year. While left-wing extremists were to blame for 3.2 percent.""

"Movimiento 26 de Julio The 26th of July Movement (Spanish: Movimiento 26 de Julio; M-26-7) was a Cuban vanguard revolutionary organization and later a political party that in 1959 overthrew the Fulgencio Batista dictatorship in Cuba. The 26th of July Movement's name originated from the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks, an army facility in the city of Santiago de Cuba, on 26 July 1953. This attack was led by a young Fidel Castro, who was a legislative candidate in a free ...election that had been cancelled by Batista. The attack had been intended as a rallying cry for the revolution.  Castro was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison but, along with his group, was granted an amnesty after two years following a political campaign on their behalf. Castro travelled to Mexico to reorganize the movement in 1955 with several other exiled revolutionaries (including Ra√∫l Castro, Camilo Cienfuegos, and Juan Almeida Bosque). Their task was to form a disciplined guerrilla force to overthrow Batista. On 2 December 1956, 82 men landed in Cuba, having sailed in the boat Granma from Tuxpan, Veracruz, ready to organize and lead a revolution. The early signs were not good for the movement. They landed in daylight, were attacked by the Cuban Air Force, and suffered numerous casualties. The landing party was split into two and wandered lost for two days, most of their supplies abandoned where they landed. They were also betrayed by their peasant guide in an ambush, which killed more of those who had landed. Batista mistakenly announced Fidel Castro's death at this point. Of the 82 who sailed aboard the Granma, only 12 eventually regrouped in the Sierra Maestra mountain range.  While the revolutionaries were setting up camp in the mountains, ""Civic Resistance"" groups were formulating in the cities, putting pressure on the Batista regime. Many middle-class and professional persons flocked toward Castro and his movement. While in the Sierra Maestra mountains the guerrilla forces attracted hundreds of Cuban volunteers and won several battles against the Cuban Army.  Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was shot in the neck and chest during the fighting, but was not severely injured. (Guevara, who had studied medicine, continued to give first aid to other wounded guerrillas.) This was the opening phase of the war of the Cuban Revolution, which continued for the next two years. It ended in January 1959, after Batista fled Cuba for Dominican Republic, on New Year's Eve when the Movement's forces marched into Havana.

"On May 25th, 2020, George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. An officer knelt on his neck, ignoring his pleas of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù‚Äî the same pleas Eric Garner made six years ago on Staten Island, NY as police murdered him via chokehold. The city of Minneapolis has since erupted with revolutionary activity. Three days after Floyd‚Äôs murder, on the night of May 28th, in an escalation unprecedented on U.S. soil, the people of Minneapolis set fire to... the Third Precinct. Video footage shows cop cars and vans fleeing the scene‚Äî rats from a sinking ship‚Äî while the people pelted them with objects and shouted at them. Floyd‚Äôs murder took place on Memorial Day: a day set aside annually by the State for the expressed purpose of celebrating its ability to expand its white supremacist empire globally. The National Guard, meanwhile, was called in in a failed attempt to crush the revolt. What the people of Minneapolis have achieved ushers in a new stage in the war against the State.

Why go through the trouble of intercontinental labor migration when a regional one could suffice? The answer is not indentured laborers' greater productivity. Most planters were convinced that their indentured Indian laborers were less productive than the Africans they supplanted. Nor was indentured labor necessarily cheaper once the considerable recruitment costs were taken into consideration. The key factor may have been that the terms of the indentured contract allowed for much greater control of the labor force. - David Northrup,Duh.

Local authorities and businessmen established a network of brothels under the Recreation and Amusement Association, which was state-funded, some in places like police dormitories. At its height, the RAA had 70,000 women working in its brot...hels, with around 80,000 at independent brothels for the 350,000 US troops in the country. The first brothel established by the RAA, Komachien (""The Babe Garden"") had 38 women, who had 15-60 clients each day. The official justification for the network was ""to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls."" US military officials were aware that some women in the brothels had been enslaved, and others coerced or tricked by responding to fake advertisements for other jobs. One 19 year old girl, Natsue Takita, responded to an ad for an office worker. She was then told the only available posts were for ""comfort women"" and persuaded to accept it. She killed herself by jumping in front of a train a few days later. A memo from Lt Col Hugh MacDonald explained ""The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family"". He also admitted that ""in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists.""

"Well everyone has an end to their competitive time in speech and debate, and most everyone has their obligatory end of career post. I‚Äôve been blanking on mine a lot because it‚Äôs been such a long run, on and off, and still feels weird it‚Äôs all over. The tldr is that I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve spent 8 years competing in speech and debate and met so many amazing people I have thanks for.  Starting back in high school, freshman year me didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd end up a debate kid until my mom sugg...ested I take it as an elective. My debate teacher and coach Mr Zuercher was formative for making me enjoy debate and wanting to purchase inconceivable amounts of books probably for the rest of my life. My best friend, Quentin McTeer, was the biggest motivator to push myself to be good in debate and want to succeed. I remember spending summers at debate camps, weekend debate tournament trips, and the unnecessary amount of time we were working on debate prep in other classes.  My two years of debate at the College of Idaho were filled with some of my closest friends and most fun memories. We only got to debate for a year, but Logan Dennis was one of my most fun partners and one of my brothers. All that blabbering incoherent rambles about Deleuze even got you to slip a quote in your senior paper. Aanish Shamim is the funniest, nerdiest person ever and has been my friend since high school. We were partners on and off for two years, but to date you‚Äôre still the only person I‚Äôve gotten 1st place at a tournament with #unr. I‚Äôll never forget our ukulele anthem PMC‚Äôs.  My last year at WWU has been a great end to my years in debate. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact you were my favorite competitor when I was at CofI I probably wouldn‚Äôt have ended up here. Chris Coles (Lila Lavender), you‚Äôre one of the smartest people I‚Äôve ever met and have appreciated your guidance in debate and beyond. Kinny Torre is also an amazing person I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve met from moving to WA. Being able to work with you at debate camps the last two summers and call you my coach and close friend is something I‚Äôm really grateful for. Sarah Wheeler and Brenner Barclay have been the worlds best teammates to have and the best company at our sometimes week long debate-ventures. Margaret Rockey was always supplying the groovy tunes and campaign to eat more chicken. And lastly, Cameron Allen, you‚Äôve been a hoot and a better partner than I could‚Äôve asked for. I‚Äôll never forget my last year of debate filled with cheaters go home, gundams and golems, jews with guns, and you forgetting to read offense.

"hi! as many of you know, I spent senior year (and will spend this upcoming summer) as an intern for prof. Colin Marshall at the UW. During my time there, our primary project was preparing the book he was editing on comparative metaethics for publication. I had the chance to proofread/copy edit the volume and hear the contributors present their work at a conference we hosted in Seattle. It‚Äôs a fascinating survey of philosophical traditions from around the world and how they challenge & disrupt western metaethical frameworks, and if you would like to check it out, you can access the ebook for free for the next seven days!

"This was going to be a very long and personal post, but I decided I didn‚Äôt want to do that. I‚Äôm coming out: I‚Äôm asexual. That probably doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal, and I know in the grand scheme of things it isn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled coming to terms with for the past several years and I finally feel like I‚Äôm in a mental place where I can be comfortable with my sexuality. Sex and sexual attraction is all around us all the time and the social pressure there is ...to participate in that has isolated me a lot over the past few years. For a long time I felt like I was missing out on some intrinsic part of being human because I‚Äôve never felt purely sexual attraction, and so I told different people that I was either straight, bi, or pan because it was easier than explaining the asexuality spectrum to people who seem incapable of understanding it. Over the past few months I‚Äôve come to a realization that *because* I can never experience that, my ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean anything. If anything, not worrying about sexual attraction or the pressure to have it means I can enjoy my romantic relationships more. I shouldn‚Äôt have to hide my sexuality.

From divorce to academic failures, to performance failures, and death of a few people who I had the privilege to serve this great country with.

It has restored and created some great friendships, I have become a much better musician, and I have learn to take some of punches and move on. I am ...truly happy for every moment that happened this year, good or bad because they are all learning experiences that will help make this coming year great.

"Hi! I‚Äôm Zac Davis and I‚Äôm looking to coach and judge for students this debate season,So you‚Äôre probably wondering why you should consider me:As a debater I was successful on the national circuit and qualified to the TOC twice despite lacking a school debate coach or strong institutional support, going 3-3 as a Junior and choosing to coach rather than attend Corona-toc. Other notable results include a positive record at NSDAs being ranked 6th in California by the NSDA, and bei...ng a runner up at the Apple Valley RR, winning the VBI Varsity tournament and reaching quarterfinals at RKS‚Äôs Varsity tournament.However, not all good debaters are good teachers. I‚Äôve always placed heavy emphasis on a strong foundation so I focused on research and understanding the philosophy behind the arguments I read. This philosophy transfers heavily into my coaching style. I want to enable students, not think for them.  I have experience coaching 40+ debaters for Policy, LD, and Parliamentary debate and have worked with programs such as PepTalk, W.indebate, ODI, VBI, UTNIF, and currently Triumph Debate. While I was still debating I founded and organized Verge Debate, a mutual prep sharing and coaching team for small school debaters without school coaches, and so I have lots of experience coordinating prep assignments, talking about strategies, and assisting with long term and pre-round preparation and a majority of our members reached TOC for the first time as Verge members. I am familiar with overcoming prep disparities, organizing collaboration in drills mocks and prep assignments, and providing specialized and flexible support to different debaters needs. Over the summer alone I‚Äôve judged 40+ rounds, so I have plenty of experience working online and in-depth knowledge of modern debate trends. In summary I‚Äôm incredibly passionate about debate content and strategy and have the experience to back it up.For those already on the circuit:I specialized in theory das and ks, but have lots of experience innovating phil and larp/policy positions as well. Whether you are looking to understand the literature behind a dense kritik or learn how to do a 1AR vs 7 off, I can help! Reach out for any more details about argumentative specifics.In Conclusion:Beyond my debate and coaching experience I want to emphasize coaching goes beyond that. While my debaters certainly will sharpen their debate skills, I emphasize even more importantly the value of presentation, conversation, and research skills debate teaches, which have benefited other aspects of my life such as academics and organization. Additionally, I encourage debaters to learn more about politics and form their own opinions and develop critical thinking skills to help make the ideas they persuade others of are good ones. I care about the emotional wellbeing of the debaters I coach, and will modify drill schedules around mental health and help coach students through tough losses.Sorry I know the pitch is long feel free to read as little or much I just want you to have access to info about me before making your decision about coaching, and if you are on the fence I recommend you reach out to students and organizations I've worked with or are working with for more information about my coaching style.Here are some emails, reach out to me if you want more.Sarah Zheng from Dulles pandazh13@gmail.comLukas Krause from Mitty lukrauwork@gmail.comOlivia He from Quarry Lane oxh38389@gmail.comDirector of LD Debate at UTNIF sunhee.simon@gmail.comODI Admin and Co-Lab Leader for Top Lab pdfox0513@gmail.comDirector of Triumph triumphdebate@gmail.comManaging Director and Head of HR of Victory Briefs Institute anthony@victorybriefs.comI hope you want to work with me in the future, and best of luck debating!Please reach out to me via pm or zacjudges@gmail.com if interested.I‚Äôm also looking to be hired to judge at any TOC bid distributing tournaments throughout the year so reach out if you need one.

"LEXINGTON COMMUNITY PLEASE READ!  Yesterday, June 4th, 2020 Lexington MA held a vigil for George Floyd a victim of police brutality, may he rest in peace. Also on this day, our town voted 122-65 to spend $125k on planning the construction of a new shooting range for local police that will amount to 3.5-5 million dollars.  When I was a senior at LHS in 2018, the shooting at Marjory Stoneham Douglas High School sparked a movement to end gun violence, especially in schools. I wa...tched and participated in protests. My peers, family, teachers, and neighbors did too. When it came to our public school system, Lexington was against the use of firearms.  Lexington Police Chief, Mark J. Corr emphasizes that ‚Äúclassroom and scenario training helps officers understanding WHEN and WHY force should be used.‚Äù (source link below) So as a Lexington youth, I have a right to know why $125,000 are being allocated to creating this plan, instead of non-violent police education and training?   We cannot pick and choose which parts to protest and support when it comes to gun violence. Changing the systemic gun violence in this country begins with our own community.  *If you agree with what's been said sign the petition at the top of this post* Presentation for Article 16a: https://www.lexingtonma.gov/‚Ä¶/article_16a_firing_range_a_4.‚Ä¶ List of Lexington Reps who voted: https://www.lexingtonma.gov/‚Ä¶/article_16a_firing_range_a_4.‚Ä¶  Representative Contact List: http://www.lexingtontmma.org/pmwiki.php‚Ä¶ Activism begins with education, so thank you to Nirmal Balachundhar for making me aware of this issue.

"The Democrats hated Christians long before Trump came along. Years ago, they were trying to get every preacher off the air.

"Many Christians think people hate us because we support Trump. The fact is, they hate Trump because he supports Christians. American Christians chafe at the notion that they are hated by the left.

"Believers need to be clear about what their vote for Biden will do to the world and what it says about them. I beg you to open your heart and mind to facts. Again, these are facts not opinions: There‚Äôs undeniable evidence of cognitive decline in Joe Biden. He often looks confused, the man can‚Äôt finish a sentence. He has the rude angry outbursts that accompany this form of decline.  He continued to give unwanted attention to females long after being warned. It‚Äôs almost as if h...e forgot to stop. Back to the issue of cognitive decline. Below are his actual words as he addressed the coronavirus. Teleprompter and all. He has embraced the full compliment of socialist evil embedded in the Democrat platform. He wants Beto O‚ÄôRourke to take away our guns. He wants to reinstate laws that oppress Christian bakers and businesses. Not opinion. Things he has just said. He is so desperate to become President that he has vowed to veer left and rally those who support the agendas of Planned Parenthood, the LGBTQ activists, and socialism. He has even made a deal with the other devil, Bernie Sanders. China lied about Covid 19. That was a devastating attack on the United States. Joe Biden has made a career of giving in to the Chinese government. He even sided with them after the pandemic started accusing Trump of racism for stopping flights from China. Attacks from China are only beginning. That of itself makes Biden a disaster and the absolute worst choice. Joe Biden is the consort of Barack Obama, who has consistently been the most hostile President in history toward the Bible. How can you call yourself a Christian and vote for Joe Biden? He is too weak to resist Obama‚Äôs war on the church. He will serve at the behest of the worst enemies of both the church and the nation. He will go after every value Christianity stands for.

"We had a pandemic that should have ignited reverence and repentance in Christians. But it didn‚Äôt. The big reason is modern preaching. That widespread moral confusion spills over into Christian sentiment about Biden. Here is my question: How can they call themselves Christians and do such an anti-Christian act as voting for Biden? The answer is simple: modern preaching. Modern preaching has produced the most Biblically illiterate generation of church-goers ever. Because of mod...ern preaching, Christians don‚Äôt know what they believe beyond their false vision of a loving, tolerant and generous God who caters to their every whim. A God to overlook their carnal lifestyle. Because of modern preaching a moral choice is not as important as ‚Äòfeeling loved.‚Äô See More","Trump has always had my vote since 2016.

Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king‚Äôs house (1 Kings 14:26).  The devil used craftiness to steal our gold. We removed mass soul-winning through the Holy Spirit. He tossed the bone of getting a big church to drooling leaders. We replaced revival with marketing and well-oiled, business entertainment centers. Grace is supposed to be a catalyst to holiness. A rampant new version of grace grants a license to lead a double life.  New Age nuances led many Spirit-filled Christians into out-of-Bible experiences. Never-never lands where emotional experiences and personal prophecies take supremacy over the Word of God.  The worst mistake was to stop teaching and leading people into the baptism of the Holy Spirit.  Most youth in Spirit-filled churches have never seen a miracle.  The result is an entire generation doesn‚Äôt know what they believe, why they believe it let alone possess authority to share it.  They embody Judges 2:10: ‚ÄúWhen all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel.‚Äù See More","GOD Forgive Us and Restore Us To Your First Intention.

"Think about God. Think of the empires He has seen rise and fall. He has witnessed the destruction of many nations. He has overseen cultures that thought they would never die. Nineveh had a sign that read ‚Äúthe city that will always be.‚Äù Nahum the prophet reminded them of the great miracle they saw with Jonah as he foretold their delayed but certain doom. God has seen delusion before. Entitlement has never stopped judgment. America has an amazing history. We have been spared de...struction again and again by divine intervention. However, something has changed. This is the first time our culture started shaking its fist at Almighty God. We have crossed over into moral unchartered waters. We have an enemy we have never faced before‚Äîourselves.  Abraham Lincoln said: ‚ÄúAt what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time or die by suicide.‚Äù1 Suicide is a big word. Suicide happens when life becomes too painful. Americans are in unbearable pain. Americans feel dread. Not since Lincoln have we been this divided. As voices drown one another out, millions in the middle truly wonder how long before destruction be our lot.  We are drowning in falsehoods. We can‚Äôt trust anything we hear in the media. And no one knows how dangerous that is because it has never happened before.  Few Americans make it through a day without alcohol, a toke, a pill, powder, or a needle. For heaven‚Äôs sake, our children are taking their own lives over shoes, pictures, texts, and messages on social media. Yet, few admit the direct correlation between our misery and rejection of God.

"In the next few years, you will likely see social media virtually remove all preaching. Not only that, but there will be a concerted effort to marginalize the church in ways you never imagined. Does that mean that Bible-based Christianity is over in America? Absolutely not! You watch: God will come out of nowhere to meet this threat.

More of them will be in politics, bus...iness, science, law, entertainment, music, or a thousand other fields of endeavor.  They will not introduce subjects‚Äîthey will introduce eras.   No one will be able to buy them off or get them to change the subject. They will operate on a disquieting plane of holiness and consecration. I believe A. W.

Just a few scriptures to remind us what God says in the Holy Bible about greed.   1 Timothy 6:9(ESV) ""But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many  senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.""... Ecclesiastes 5:10 (NIV) ""Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never  satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless."" Matthew 19:24 (NLT) ""I'll say it again--it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle  than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"" Money is power, influence, and overall wealth. Don't become so enamored with the possibilities money offers that you lose sight of what is truly important. 1 Corinthians 6:10 says that the greedy will not inherit the kingdom of God. Don't trade in your eternal blessing for temporary wealth. Hebrews 13:5 (NIV) ""Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you  have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.'"" 2 Corinthians 9:7 (NIV) ""Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not  reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.""

"SOMETIMES THE GOOD LORD JUST GIVES YOU A PERFECT DAY!  Amazing hike with my best girl today. Just short of ten miles over some ornery terrain. My girls got grit! Here‚Äôs the kicker.......There was about 25 or so of us at this lake resting, having a snack and hydrating. I recall an Asian American family (3 generations), a mixed race couple, a lesbian couple, twin brothers, 3 high school girls, two other younger couples, and my wife and I. Oh and 3 dogs. We all sat on some big r...ocks overlooking the lake. We talked amongst each other, showed photos of past adventures, laughed and enjoyed an easy and carefree environment I haven‚Äôt felt in months. Next thing the patriarch of the Asian American family busts out the Almond Roca and passes it around, insisting we all take a piece. Suddenly we‚Äôre all sharing snacks!

"A profound feeling of loneliness tried to settle in on me today. A loneliness only to be matched by the bitter frustration of watching the disjointed American Church being so totally punked by billionaire frat boys. If calling you ‚Äòchicken‚Äô is what it takes to offend you and wake you up, dear leader, then, ‚ÄúCluck, cluck.‚Äù My greatest agony is the fact that this war is so very winnable! We are a voice that can be so loud and so forceful. In fact, there is no movement in Americ...a‚Äîthere is no lobby in America‚Äîthere is no people group‚Äîwith more firepower than the church. The fact is that if the churches in L.A. joined together and galvanized against the threat, it would end overnight. The idea that we are racist and hateful is preposterous.  But we do look like clowns when we accept that label and let it stop us. At this hour, God needs to apply the electrode paddles to the faintly beating heart of the American Church and jolt us back to our first love and fresh fire. It is time for us to hear the words of Nehemiah, and act on them: ‚ÄúAnd I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid of them.

"I met Josh and Dana in Everson through an R-90 signing event. They are on the front lines fighting for the victims in the sex trafficking trade.  It's important for us to recognize this issue is in our midst, but also to know about people serving in the trenches to help rescue victims right here in Whatcom County.  I was so impressed by their love and sincerity, I wanted you to meet them too. Dana Parriera - Advocacy Director at International Saints and Abolitionists: ‚ÄúSeven ...years ago, my husband went to Cambodia. Before he went, somebody said ‚ÄòHey, you should look at this organization there and take a tour.‚Äô So he goes on this tour, and it‚Äôs an organization that fights child sex trafficking and they do rescues and raids and rehabilitation, and he comes back ruined.   At first, I thought, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do this, it hits too much of a soft spot for me.‚Äô But then I literally couldn‚Äôt sleep at night. It took some time, but after a while, I just realized, ‚ÄòI know it may be sensitive for me, but that makes me more passionate.‚Äô And once my heart broke for it, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I care about the number of people who are getting pulled into the sex trade because it looks glamorous, but really it‚Äôs all a trap. The girls I know who are coming out of it, they are survivors and they are thrivers but it does so much damage to them, to their personhood. So three years ago, we decided to start our own organization that focuses on prevention and intervention in America by focusing on the Christian Church. We‚Äôre called International Saints and Abolitionists (ISA). My goal is to make advocates out of everybody. Everyone wants to stop sex trafficking but no one wants to learn about slavery. I think if people knew really what it is and what our sexual freedom is creating, I think they would question it. I delve into the research side. I interview sex-trafficked survivors so I can figure out what we‚Äôre missing. I‚Äôve met some really awesome people. My interviews are three hours long but they sit down and they tell you their whole story and then all of a sudden we‚Äôre friends because I know their nitty-gritty and I love them anyway. https://www.saintsandabolitionists.com/ Thank you to Allyn Sims for her work on this feature.

"Earlier this year I took a class on the American Revolution with one of my favorite history professors at Western. I learned a lot, and read some great books, but one thing stuck out to me.  Most people know that the Founders did not set out to declare independence. In fact they wanted to try and fix the problems they had with Great Britain, and continue the relationship as British Colonies. At some point however opinions shifted and independence became the preferred option. ...Some historians have said however that this shift was not top down as commonly believed, but bottom up. The average British subjects that had little power, and no political connections were the ones that influenced the people in Philadelphia with power. The PEOPLE finally said that they had enough, and that independence was what they wanted. I‚Äôve heard a lot of people say the American Revolution was thought of and started by the powerful elite, but that is just not right, it was truly a revolution by the people.  On this day when there is so much negativity in this country, remember it‚Äôs origins in the PEOPLE.

"‚ÄúThese are the times that try men's [Citizen‚Äôs] souls.‚Äù  Apt  words from the pen of Revolutionary founder, Thomas Paine.  I guess this isn‚Äôt the first time our land has been in a dicey situation. I speak here as a person who believes that one may bend their knee to only one Master. For me, that Master is the Jesus of the Bible. And, I do place all other allegiances in a far lower category of my existence. At the same time, I am an American citizen, with all the due rights and... responsibilities of one who vows, ‚ÄúI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands.‚Äù I bow to no president. But, I pledge full participation in this experiment in representative democracy that is a full system; greater than any one man. Let me remind all of my friends blue and red, that we are not about a President, but about a big idea and a big experiment (I believe Divinely-inspired experiment), wherein our forefathers sought to create a non-religiously run government, with full religious freedom; a durable form of government with checks and balances to keep it safe from ‚Äúidiot kings and princes‚Äù.  So far, in spite of better and worse presidents, this idea of a representative system that reflects the consent of the governed has proven to have been pretty durable. I urge all colors, politically and otherwise to ‚Äústand in the place where you live‚Äù (thank you REM), yet engage others of different views by seeking understanding, seeking peace, operating in love and mercy. And, by all rights, vote for the people of your choice. Oppose poor ideas, but there is no room, to in any way, assault people for their views. It should be safe to go to any lecture. It should be safe to engage others in conversation, even passionate debate ‚Äì and to do so without fear and with due respect. I don‚Äôt consider myself a coward or one lacking conviction when I call for ‚Äúpeace, love and understanding‚Äù (thank you Mr. Costello). I think this approach to decent civil discourse is our God-given and Constitutional right ‚Äì and even more ‚Äì our duty. If we don‚Äôt change our approach, ‚ÄúI see a bad moon arisin‚Äô‚Äù (Creedence) and to quote Bob Dylan ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a weatherman to see which way the wind blows‚Äù.  If we don‚Äôt change our course, we will be our own undoing!

"On July 21st, my grandmother passed away. It was hard to see her in so much pain during her last few weeks of life. Sometimes when we would video call her, she could barely stay awake to say hello. Eventually, she was being hydrated, fed, and given oxygen though tubes. However, I hate remembering her like  that. Instead, I choose to remember her for the remarkable woman she was. When I was a child, she came to Texas to visit us. Her and my Lolo Pete took care of us, played wi...th us, and showered us in so much love. I eat my sweet potatoes mashed with butter and cream because that‚Äôs the way she made them for me. She wanted us to be sage and would also watch us when we would swim in the pool, even though my sister and I already knew how to swim. Lola was a large part of my childhood and left me with so many wonderful memories.  During the last few months, Lola would sometimes forget who and my sister were. However, she took the extra effort to speak to my sister and I in English because we couldn‚Äôt speak to her in Ilocano. It warms my heart that even in her old age, she tried hard to connect and communicate with me. The last time I called her, I remember her being very tired and sleepy. Despite that, she still woke up to tell me hello and how much she loved me. Lola always said, ‚Äúlove you todo todo, no preno‚Äù, which roughly translates to ‚ÄúI love you with no brakes‚Äù. She truly loved me, even though I was halfway across the world and couldn‚Äôt see her in person often. Djanaya and I would not be able to make it to the funeral, but we wanted to find some way to honor her memory. We took these photos to have one last memory with our Lola and lit candles in her honor.

"The equation of primarily nonviolent protests for racial justice with ""violent mobs,"" and the vague promise to restore ""law-and-order"" with force, is textbook fascism. Trump, Pence, and their surrogates are trying to convince voters that Trump, a strongman, would be able to round up and jail protesters with military force. The wish that protesters would stay home and that everyone submit to God and country (""Biden hates God,"" or Pence saying ""the election is about whether Ame...rica stays America"") is authoritarian propaganda that enables the paramilitary violence committed by the Proud Boys, or militia members like Kyle Rittinghouse. ""Back the Blue"" groups, whose members use semiautomatic rifles to kill and injure protesters in the name of defending the authorities, are becoming increasingly similar to the German Freikorps, paramilitary units that - with government approval - had beaten and killed Communists after World War One.  Of course, if ""law-and-order"" just means ""Send in the National Guard to hang around in case someone dies, but respect people's First Amendment rights,"" Biden would be doing that if he were president anyway, so there's no evidence he'd make cities ""less safe.""
