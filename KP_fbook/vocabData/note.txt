There are a couple of wordlist that were tried out

1. gsl
2. ngsl
3. awl
4. nawl
5. acl


I decided to throw out the gsl as it was too similar to the ngsl which was better since
it's more recent (2013 vs 1950's)

I thought that would be teh same between the awl and nawl but upon quick examination,
the outputs of these lists are very different
